The group, consisting of Eldren, Rock, Bo, and Trigg, continued their exploration of the catacombs beneath the Chantry. They discovered that the chanting they had been hearing was growing fainter, leading them to double back and follow the sound. They encountered a large chamber filled with foul-smelling water and a pit in the corner. The chanting was louder here, indicating they were on the right path.

Eldren suggested using the spell "Pass Without Trace" to move stealthily past the holes in the floor. Despite some of the group members being naturally unstealthy, the spell provided a significant boost, allowing them to move quietly. They continued down the hallway, with the chanting growing louder, indicating they were moving in the right direction.

However, Rock, who was wearing heavy armor, made a noise that could potentially alert any creatures in the catacombs to their presence. The group was deciding their next move when the session ended.
In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party continues their exploration of a dark, bone-filled catacomb. As they navigate, they encounter a sinkhole, which nearly swallows Rock, the heavily armored character. However, he manages to save himself with a successful dexterity saving throw. 

The party hears chanting in Abyssal, a language none of them understand. However, Rock recognizes two words: Azarum, the name of the Orc civilization, and Orcus, a name associated with necromancy. This revelation causes unease among the party, who decide to proceed with caution. 

Bo, the stealthy character, takes the lead and discovers a room filled with ghouls and a human figure in tattered red robes, presumably the missing archbishop. The archbishop is performing a ritual with a skull in green flame. Upon being spotted, the archbishop welcomes the party to "Death's Embrace" and a battle ensues. 

Eldren, another party member, rushes in and casts Thunderwave, a powerful spell that damages and pushes back all the ghouls. He then summons his Starfire Archer and shoots the archbishop with a radiant arrow. The archbishop, in turn, casts Spirit Guardians, a spell that summons spirits to protect him. 

Bo retaliates by shooting the archbishop with a crossbow, dealing both piercing and psychic damage. Trigger, another party member, casts Chromatic Orb, dealing thunder damage to the archbishop. Despite the heavy damage inflicted, the archbishop shows no physical reaction, leading the party to suspect that the skull he's holding might be the key to defeating him. The session ends with the ghouls attacking Bo.
In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party continues their battle against the Archbishop and his ghouls in the catacombs. Eldren, the druid, uses a Thunderwave spell to damage the Archbishop and two ghouls, causing one ghoul to disintegrate and the other to be fatally injured. The Archbishop, despite being severely wounded, continues his ritual with a skull, which begins to show hairline fractures.

Eldren then attacks the Archbishop with a Starry Form Archer, causing the Archbishop to collapse, though the ritual continues. The skull's eyes flare, and a bolt of necrotic energy strikes Eldren, causing him to fall unconscious. Beau, the rogue, kills a ghoul, while Trigger, the wizard, attempts to destroy the skull with magic missiles but misses.

Rock, the fighter, kills the last ghoul and charges towards the skull, taking damage from the Archbishop's Spirit Guardians spell. He uses an action surge to cast Thunderwave, causing the Archbishop's body to skitter away and the skull to fracture further. Suddenly, the skull explodes in a burst of green flame, and the party is forced to make constitution saving throws. The session ends on this cliffhanger.
In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party, consisting of Eldren, Beau, Trey, and Rock, successfully defeated a necromantic entity inhabiting a skull in the catacombs beneath the Chantry. The entity was revealed to be the Archbishop, who had been taken over by evil spirits and was chanting the name "Orcus." The party managed to destroy the skull, thus ending the necromantic threat.

After the battle, the party was severely injured and decided to return to the surface. They were met by Tybalt, Mila, and Bishop Zorian, who were shocked and devastated to see the Archbishop's body. The party explained the situation and were rewarded with 500 gold for their efforts.

Despite their injuries, the party decided to take a short rest and then return to the catacombs to explore the areas they had previously missed. They found a room that had been ransacked, with books torn apart and pages scattered. They collected the pages for further investigation. In the same room, they also found a small glass vial containing a fizzy, slightly green liquid that they suspected might be a potion of gaseous form.

The party decided not to explore the stinky water area and instead chose to return to the surface with their findings. The session ended with the party planning to identify the mysterious potion and rest before their next adventure.
In this session of the Dungeons and Dragons campaign, the Genesis Gambit team successfully defeated the evil entity in the Chantry of Dawn's basement. The entity was revealed to be a possessed Archbishop, who was unfortunately killed in the process. The team managed to retrieve some documents, a potion, and a handful of emerald stones from the basement. 

Upon returning to the surface, they informed Tybalt, a priest at the Chantry, about the Archbishop's fate and the lingering evil in the basement. They advised him to either seal the basement or have it cleansed. The team also offered Tybalt safe passage to Novigrad if he ever felt outcasted by the church. 

The team then returned to Novigrad and entered a downtime period. They received a payment of 686 gold pieces for their work, which they discussed investing in various areas such as the spy network, the quartermaster's network, the scout corps, or improving the effectiveness of their fighting forces. However, they decided to prioritize information gathering, considering investing in the spy and scouting networks. 

The session ended with Trigger suggesting they head to Muscovar and investigate a certain individual, potentially setting the direction for their next adventure.
In this session of the role-playing game, the group discusses their strategy for allocating resources and investing in their networks. They decide to keep a couple of hundred gold as "walking around money" for immediate needs like travel and random item purchases, and invest the rest in long-term projects. They consider investing in a spy network, which they believe will be beneficial in the long run. They also discuss the possibility of crafting magic items, which would require some gold for resources.

The group also reflects on their recent combat encounters, noting that they've had combat in every session so far. They express a desire to keep the action consistent, rather than having long stretches without combat. 

One of the characters, Aldrin, has died twice in the game so far, once from falling into a pit. The group jokes about this, suggesting they should invest in hay and flowers to keep Aldrin happy. 

The group also discusses the need to get to know the non-player characters (NPCs) better and the importance of increasing their prestige by completing jobs and being flashy. They acknowledge that they are in competition with other merchant companies and that their success may attract more enemies. 

Finally, they discuss the character's abilities, particularly the druid's ability to shape-shift into animals they have seen before. They joke about the possibilities this could bring to the game, such as conjuring a swarm of owls or riding a T-Rex. 

The session ends with the group looking forward to making their investment decisions in the next session. One of the players, however, will be absent for the next two weeks due to a family vacation.
