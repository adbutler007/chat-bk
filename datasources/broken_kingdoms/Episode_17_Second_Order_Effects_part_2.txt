In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party, consisting of Frankie Fighter, a Warlock, a Druid, and a Sorcerer, decided to take a short rest after a previous encounter. During this time, they interacted with a captive Frost Giant named Ragnar, who was tied up and suffering from a hangover. The party decided to free Ragnar after their rest, hoping he would help them fight the goblins that had previously attacked them.

After their rest, the party and Ragnar moved through the fortress, with Ragnar breaking through doors due to his size. They encountered three goblins, which they quickly dispatched with the help of the Frost Giant. However, as they moved further into the fortress, another door opened ominously, prompting the party to prepare for another potential encounter.

The party then rolled for initiative, preparing for the upcoming battle. The Druid, who was low on spell slots, decided to use a Thorn Whip cantrip against one of the goblins. The party also noticed a muscular goblin carrying a large axe and a goblin queen in the back, indicating a challenging fight ahead.
In this session of the role-playing game, the team continues their battle against the goblin queen and her minions. The queen summons more minions to her aid, but the team manages to hold their ground. Jacob Viburnum uses his Thorn Whip and Starry Form Archer abilities to attack the Spine Cleaver, a muscular goblin wielding a greataxe. Despite the damage, the Spine Cleaver remains standing.

Meanwhile, the queen attacks Mikey, a turtle-like character, with her short sword, managing to hit him once. Mikey had previously attacked the queen with his nunchuck and claws, landing a successful hit with his claws.

Gift, another team member, attempts to use Toll the Dead on the queen, but she successfully resists the spell. Gift also heals Viburnum, restoring some of his hit points.

Frankie, also known as Deadpool, engages in combat with the Spine Cleaver, using his scimitar and healing himself with Second Wind. He also uses an Action Surge to attack again.

The team's ally, a frost giant, unleashes a powerful attack that kills several minions and severely injures the remaining enemies. However, the exertion causes him to vomit and pass out.

Finally, Viserion, a gold dragonborn sorcerer, enters the fray. He uses his fire breath on the Spine Cleaver, opening his mouth impossibly wide to unleash the attack. The outcome of this attack is yet to be determined.
In this session of the Dungeons and Dragons game, the party continues their battle against the Goblin Queen and her minions. Jacob Viburnum starts the round by attacking the Queen with his archer, dealing significant damage. The Queen retaliates by attacking Mikey and Gift, but Gift uses Silvery Barbs to make her miss. The Queen then retreats, calling more goblins from a nearby room to join the fight.

Adam attempts to attack the Queen with a Chromatic Orb but misses. The Frost Giant, still recovering from his previous attack, does nothing. The minions attack Gift and Deadpool but both miss. Deadpool then eliminates two minions with his scimitars.

Gift uses a psychic attack on a goblin wizard, dealing minor damage, and casts Sanctuary on herself before moving into the fray. Mikey, despite being in a precarious situation, manages to land a hit on one of the goblins.

The session ends with the Curse Spitter casting a spell on Mikey, who manages to resist its effects. The party is still in the midst of battle, with the Goblin Queen and her minions posing a significant threat.
The party continued their battle against the goblins in the castle. After a series of attacks, the goblin queen called for a parley, offering to leave the castle and give the party all the gold and items they had accumulated in exchange for their lives. The party agreed, and the queen led them to a room filled with gold, spell scrolls, a potion, and a monocle. 

Meanwhile, Mikey and Viserion explored another room where they found a locked door. A goblin named Blister was trapped inside, claiming he was locked up because he disagreed with the goblins' actions. Mikey convinced the queen to give him the key to free Blister, who expressed interest in joining the party. 

The giant, Ragnar, asked if he could kill one of the goblins before they left. The queen subtly indicated the underboss, whom Ragnar promptly crushed under his foot. The remaining goblins quickly left the castle. 

Ragnar revealed that he was on a pilgrimage, visiting significant places from the war against the Faceless Worm. He had been shamed twice, once in a town where the heroes, giants, and dragons were buried, and again when he was captured by the goblins. Despite his shame, he decided to continue his pilgrimage. The party invited Ragnar to join them, but he declined, choosing to continue his journey alone.
In this session, the group of adventurers, consisting of Frankie Fighter, Viscerion, Gift, and Blister, successfully cleared out the goblin-infested tower. They found a treasure chest containing 233 gold pieces, a potion of climbing, a spell scroll of cure wounds, a spell scroll of lesser restoration, and a recipe for a potent poison. 

They also encountered a frost giant named Ragnar, who was on a pilgrimage to visit the Brass Door, a site of a great battle. Ragnar shared stories about his father, Jarl Storvald, who led the Frost Giants in the great fight. The group invited Ragnar to join their company, Genesis Gambit, but he declined, stating he would consider it after his pilgrimage. 

The group then decided to test Blister's skills. Frankie Fighter challenged Blister to sneak a firecracker into Viscerion's pocket, which he successfully did, causing a small explosion. This revealed Blister's potential as a recruit for their company. 

The group discussed allocating Blister to one of the officer titles, such as quartermaster, scout, or spymaster, but decided to defer the decision. They also considered using the poison recipe, but decided to wait due to its high cost. 

The session ended with the group deciding to wait for their senior officers to return from the casino job before making any major decisions. They also leveled up to level three.
The players discussed their next steps in the game. They decided to follow up on the research about the hobgoblin ghost, the old king they had encountered. They planned to visit the library to learn more about his history and the kind of king he was. They also decided to visit Luca, the head of the clock in Riga, who runs a coffee house and jazz bar. They considered this visit as an opportunity to introduce themselves or potentially purchase something from Luca that Daria didn't have. They also planned to visit a zoo in Riga, a big city, to see the various creatures that exist in the game world. The players agreed to continue their game next week, with a visit to a casino in Florida also on the agenda. They also mentioned a real-life meeting in New York City on the 12th.
