The group began by discussing their upcoming plans, including the Archbishop's coronation and the casino heist. They also considered visiting the Minotaur librarian in Riga. They noted the casino's isolated location and discussed potential escape routes and strategies.

Hawthorne, a scout, led the group to various spots in the forest where they found the remains of small animals that had been brutally killed. Eldrin attempted to track the creature responsible, but was unable to do so. The group found large paw prints that didn't match any known animal. They also found shards of bone that appeared to have been worked on, suggesting the presence of an intelligent creature.

Eldrin attempted to use his nature skills to identify the creature, but was unsuccessful. The group considered the possibility that the creature could be a pet or a druid. They also discussed setting up alarms or traps to protect themselves.

The group decided to return to the castle and inform the others about the potential threat. They also planned to return to the forest with different spells to further investigate the mysterious creature.
The Genesis Gambit group prepares to attend the Archbishop's ceremony and the casino job. Valiant uses the company's operating costs to buy each member fancy clothes for the events. Trigger decides to stay at Castle Rend and work on his projects, while the rest of the group plans to attend the ceremony. Valiant has a private conversation with Grimm, expressing her appreciation for his presence in the company and encouraging him to fully commit to the group. She also mentions a small iron chest that contains items that could help the group in case she is unable to do so.

The group discusses the security of Castle Rend while they are away, deciding to station a full-time guard and close the gates. They feel comfortable leaving Trigger and Martin in charge, with nearly 50 other people present. The group travels to the Chantry of Dawn via riverboats, arriving in the farming community where the Chantry is located. They notice a significant guard presence at the Chantry, including guards from the Chantry and guards from Baku. As they prepare to enter the Chantry for the ceremony, they observe that all attendees are being thoroughly searched and disarmed.
The party, consisting of Valiant, Eldrin, and Rock, arrive at the Chantry for the ceremony of the new Archbishop. They are met by Tybalt Ashbrow, who informs them that the King of Baku and a VIP from Osora will be attending the event. Rock, having a history with the King, decides to distance himself from the event and waits outside.

Tybalt introduces the party to two older figures, a purple tiefling named Purpose and a black dragonborn named Erasmus. Purpose is the Chancellor of the Academy in Baku, while Erasmus is a tavern owner in Lake Rest. They were friends of the former Archbishop and express their gratitude to the party for retrieving his body. Erasmus also mentions a fourth member of their adventuring party, Belagar Redsmith, the forge father of Crag Hall, who will be attending the ceremony.

The party then takes their seats, with Eldrin keeping an eye out for any suspicious behavior. However, he only notices the general nervousness of the attendees due to the importance of the event. Purpose invites the party to visit the Academy in Baku, offering them access to its library as a token of gratitude for saving their friend.
The group attends the coronation of Archbishop Zorian at the Chantry. The ceremony is attended by various notable figures including the Fisher King of Baku, a young human woman, a wood elf woman named Aoife O'Regan, and a mountain dwarf named Belagar Redsmith. The ceremony is a lengthy and traditional affair, with prayers, hymns, and rituals. 

Before the reception, Belagar Redsmith makes a speech honoring the previous Archbishop, Stenz Novak, and expressing hope that Zorian will follow in his footsteps. The group finds this speech intriguing and plans to approach Redsmith later for more information.

During the reception, Eldrin speaks with Aoife O'Regan, sharing his recent encounter with a strange creature in the forest. Aoife suggests that the creature could have been a manticore or a chimera. They also discuss the current state of their homeland, Osora, and Aoife reveals that she was in Baku for negotiations with the king. 

Meanwhile, Rock observes the event from a distance, noting the presence of guards and the arrival and departure of the guests. The group plans to engage in more conversations during the reception to gather more information.
The characters attend a reception where they interact with various important figures. They first approach King Dobermire, who is known for his greed and gluttony. They discuss the bone fragments they found, but the King is unable to provide any help. They also meet Aoife, a formidable elder from the forest, who is respected and feared by many. 

Next, they introduce themselves to Bellagar Redsmith, the Forge Father of Crag Hall, who is surprised to meet them. Valiant, the leader of Genesis Gambit, strikes up a conversation with Bellagar, who seems interested in their stories. Bellagar is revealed to be a master smith and a potential ally for the group.

Specter, a drow member of the group, converses with Jester Greenhill, a halfling who has made a fortune through trading. Jester reveals he is on his way to a gambling tournament at a casino. He also shares news about a dragon named Tenerax who has taken over Crossbones, his hometown. Jester warns that King Dobermire might be the one to start the next war.

Finally, the group interacts with Bellagar again, who invites them to toast to his friend. He shares about his life in Crag Hall, a city deep underground where the inhabitants value their craftsmanship over their living conditions. He also expresses his discomfort with Specter due to his drow heritage, but allows him to live due to his politeness.
During the reception, the party was engaged in casual conversation when suddenly, a young woman was shot with three arrows and killed instantly. The arrows came from the direction of the trees, causing panic among the guests. The party quickly rolled for initiative to respond to the attack.

Specter was the first to act, retrieving his weapon from the portable hole and moving towards the trees for cover. He also began to climb a tree for a better vantage point. Grim, who was next, moved towards the king and the archbishop to inquire about the attack. He then decided to stay close to them for protection.

Bo cast invisibility on himself and moved towards the bushes to avoid being an easy target. His plan was to get behind the attacker without being seen. Eldrin transformed into a warhorse and moved towards Rock, intending to pick him up and charge towards the attacker.

However, before they could execute their plan, three more arrows were shot from the trees, killing two guards and a party-goer. The guests began to flee indoors for safety. Specter decided to hold his action due to the lack of cover in the open area. Grim followed the crowd, moving towards the king and the archbishop for protection.

Bo continued his approach towards the direction of the arrows, but failed to spot the attacker due to a low perception roll. Eldrin, still in his warhorse form, managed to reach Rock and was ready to charge back towards the attacker. The session ended with the party preparing to counter-attack.
During this session of the role-playing game, the characters were attending a party when they were suddenly attacked by unseen assailants. The attackers used arrows to kill two guards and a party-goer, but did not target the player characters. The characters tried to locate the source of the arrows, which seemed to be coming from the trees behind a pond. 

Eldren transformed into a warhorse and Rock rode on his back, charging towards the direction of the arrows. As they crossed a stream, they were briefly entangled by magical vines but managed to break free and continue their charge. 

Meanwhile, Beau spotted a giant hyena hiding in the trees. The hyena seemed to respond to a whistle from the direction of the arrows and then ran off into the forest, disappearing abruptly as if by magic. Beau attempted to chase the hyena but lost sight of it. 

Back at the party, Grim tried to calm the panicked guests and asked the king and Belagar if they had any idea what was happening. The king seemed nonchalant about the attack, suggesting that it was probably an assassination attempt on him. 

Despite their efforts, the characters were unable to locate the attackers or the hyena. The session ended with them regrouping and trying to figure out their next move.
In this session, the characters are at a party when an attack occurs. An archer, who never misses, shoots and kills a young woman named Princess Popplestone, the niece of a noble merchant from Suncrest and the date of the king. The characters, along with other guards, try to track down the archer but are unsuccessful. They find the remains of a meal that a giant hyena had, which is similar to the kill zone they found around Kessel Run. Eldrin tries to find any remnants of the creature but fails despite a high survival check.

The characters then return to the party and discuss the incident. They find it odd that the archer chose to kill the princess despite there being more high-profile targets present. They speculate that the assassination might be an attempt to start a conflict. They decide to investigate further and plan to debrief with the rest of the cast. The session ends before they can open a care package from Daria.
