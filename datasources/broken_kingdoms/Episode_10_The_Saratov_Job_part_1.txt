The party continued their journey south down the Stone Road towards the site of their next job, the bank job in Saratov. On the way, they encountered a two-headed giant named Boris, who was sleeping with a treasure chest. The party managed to sneak past him with the help of Trigger's magical tinkering, which created a white noise to mask their movements. 

They continued their journey, passing other travelers and warning them about Boris. As they neared their destination, Elgin expressed concern that they hadn't seen any signs from their scout, Hawthorne. Trigger sent his bird, Tak, to scout the area, but the bird didn't find anything unusual. The party eventually found the spot where they were supposed to head off the road into the hills, closer to Saratov.
The group, Genesis Gambit, continues their journey towards Saratov, navigating through craggy hills and scrubland. Suddenly, Trigger loses touch with his familiar, Toc, indicating danger ahead. They decide to proceed cautiously, despite the potential threat.

They encounter a knight named Sir Percival Hawkins, a lieutenant of the Silver Suns. He reveals that they are also there for the bank job, turning the mission into a competition. The group is led to a hidden campsite where they meet Titus Prolix, Chief of Staff to the Chairwoman of the Bank of Riga. He informs them that the competition will commence in the morning and advises them to rest.

They also reunite with Hawthorne and the rest of their scout company, who were being held captive. The group sets up camp and decides to visit the Barrowmen, a friendly group also participating in the competition. They learn that the Barrowmen arrived a day earlier and have been dealing with the arrogant Silver Suns.

During the conversation, they discover that a giant has been spotted in Raventree, a town associated with the Barrowmen. The news upsets Nadia, the commander of the Barrowmen, as they were unaware of the threat in their town. The group expresses regret for not dealing with the giant when they had the chance. The session ends with the group preparing for the competition and the challenges that lie ahead.
In this session of the role-playing game, the Genesis Gambit group is at a campsite with other groups, including the Barrowmen, the Silver Suns, and Titus, a Dragonborn banker. The group discusses the situation with a frost giant causing a disturbance at a cemetery, which they had previously decided to avoid due to time constraints. They agree to help the Barrowmen deal with the giant after their current mission.

Sir Percival from the Silver Suns approaches the group, asking if they have any information about their current location, Saratov, from their chronicle. The group decides not to share any information with him, considering the chronicle as an asset to be protected. They also contemplate providing misinformation to misdirect the Silver Suns.

Trigger, one of the group members, approaches Titus to inquire about any spell scrolls he might have for trade. However, Titus reveals that he doesn't possess any such items as his talents lie outside of the arcane.

Later, the group consults their chronicle and learns more about Saratov. The city was known for its many temples and cults, which led to its downfall during an orc invasion. The city is now a common hiding place for criminals, cultists, and wandering monsters. The group also learns about a place called the "Stone Garden" within the city, where the original Genesis Gambit group had an unfortunate encounter.

The group decides to discuss this information amongst themselves in the morning, keeping it confidential from the other groups.
The group, Genesis Gambit, wakes up in the morning to find that the Barrowmen have left. Titus, the leader of the Silver Suns, briefs them on their mission: to retrieve a small cauldron from the ruins of the city. The cauldron is located in a chamber within one of the city's hills, surrounded by a statue garden. However, the exact location is unknown, and it's up to the group to find it. The team that brings back the cauldron will be rewarded with 400 gold, while those who fail but return safely will receive 50 gold.

Before they set off, Titus presents them with non-disclosure agreements to sign, ensuring the mission's confidentiality. Percival, the leader of the Silver Suns, signs immediately, followed by Beau. Rock, the lieutenant of Genesis Gambit, signs reluctantly after some teasing from his team.

The group then discusses their strategy. Eldrin suggests using his bird, Toc, to scout from the air, while Rock considers the city's layout and the potential location of the statue garden. They decide to send Toc up once they're a safe distance from the Silver Suns.

As they journey into the city, Eldrin guides them efficiently, avoiding potential hazards. However, they come across a disturbing sight: a fresh puddle of blood under an ancient skeleton. The source of the blood is unknown, adding an element of danger and mystery to their mission.
In this role-playing game session, the group of adventurers, consisting of Eldren, Rock, Grim, Trigger, and Bo, are navigating through a desolate city. They encounter a puddle of blood under a mummified corpse, which turns out to be a dangerous entity that attacks Grim. After a brief skirmish, they manage to repel it and decide to avoid such hazards in the future.

Guided by Eldren's survival skills and Trigger's directions, the group moves towards a hill covered in lush vegetation. They hear chittering and laughter, which turns out to be small plant-like creatures, referred to as "thorn kids". The creatures trap the group by causing thorns to burst from the ground, blocking their exit.

A battle ensues, with Rock leading the charge, followed by Grim. The thorn kids spit wooden darts at the group, injuring Rock. Trigger uses a firebolt spell on one of the creatures, causing significant damage, while Eldren casts an entangle spell, restraining one of the creatures. Bo attempts to shoot one of the creatures but misses, though he successfully uses a telekinetic shove to push one off a cliff.

The session ends with Rock and Grim engaging one of the creatures in close combat. The group's strategy appears to be focusing on using their abilities to control the battlefield and whittle down their enemies.
In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party continued their battle against the wooden creatures. Rock, with the help of War Cry, dealt significant damage to creature B, while Grim successfully eliminated creature C that was grappling his leg. Creature D managed to escape, while creature A was severely damaged by Bo's psychic attacks. 

During the battle, Eldrin noticed a ghostly hobgoblin who warned them of a larger threat approaching. The party then heard a loud, Jurassic Park-like thumping sound, indicating the arrival of a massive tree monster. The tree monster charged at Trigger and Bo, dealing significant damage and knocking Trigger prone. The session ended on a cliffhanger, with the party preparing to face off against this new, formidable enemy.
In this session of the role-playing game, the group of adventurers continue their journey through a ruined city. They encounter a ghost of a hobgoblin who seems to be observing their actions. Suddenly, they are attacked by a monstrous tree troll. The group engages in a fierce battle with the creature, using a variety of spells and attacks. Trigger, the gnome wizard, uses Chromatic Orb to deal fire damage, while Eldren, the druid, casts Faerie Fire to make the monster easier to hit. Bo, the rogue, uses Healing Word to restore some of Trigger's health, and Grim, the warforged, casts Bane to weaken the monster's attacks. Rock, the fighter, also lands a critical hit on the monster.

Despite the monster's attempts to defend itself by forming a bramble shield, Eldren manages to finish it off with a Guiding Bolt spell. After the battle, the group finds a magical wooden shield that was once part of the monster's bramble shield. Eldren decides to keep it and plans to attune to it later.

The group considers taking a short rest to recover, but Rock reminds them of the urgency of their mission. They decide to press on, with the ghost of the hobgoblin continuing to observe their actions. The session ends with the group planning their next steps in the ruined city.
The transcript does not provide information about a role-playing game session. Instead, it discusses a planned trip to Cuba, the speaker's clean record and previous security clearance, and a future trip to Florida. The speaker mentions that they will be part of a delegation sponsored by the State Department for the Cuba trip and that the vetting process for this trip has already begun. They also express interest in writing an article about the experience. The group also discusses plans for a trip to Florida, with arrangements for flights and accommodation (an Airbnb) already in place.
