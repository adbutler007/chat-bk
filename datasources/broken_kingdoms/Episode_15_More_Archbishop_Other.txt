The group reconvened at the Chantry after an assassination attempt during the Archbishop's coronation. The assassin targeted a young noblewoman, Princess Popplestone, who was attending the event with the King of Baku. The assassin, who was an expert archer, also killed several guards from Baku before fleeing with a giant hyena. The group discovered that the tracks of the hyena matched those found near their castle, suggesting a connection.

The group met several individuals at the event, including Erasmus, a Black Dragonborn, Chancellor Purpose of the Zoria Academy, Belagar Redsmith, a master smith, and Jester Greenhill, a halfling planning to attend a tournament. They also met Aoife Uregan, a diplomat from the forest city of Osara.

Upon investigating the arrows used in the assassination, Eldrin found that the arrowheads were made of bone and the shafts were made of ironwood from Osara. The group speculated that the King of Baku might have orchestrated the assassination himself. Valiant attempted to read the King's mind but found him repeating the same thought over and over, suggesting he was hiding something. The group decided to question the King about the possible motives behind the assassination.
In this role-playing game session, the characters are investigating the assassination of a character named Princess, who is a low to mid-level noble. The characters are trying to figure out who is behind the assassination and why it happened. 

Specter, one of the characters, notices a server who seems unusually calm given the circumstances. He decides to approach the server, using a distraction created by Bo to get close without being noticed. Specter then threatens the server with a dagger, demanding to know if he was involved in the assassination. 

The server reveals that he is part of a group called Genesis Gambit, and that they were hoping to catch a "bigger prize" by causing chaos with the assassination. The server's calm demeanor and cryptic words suggest that there is a larger plot at play. 

Meanwhile, other characters discuss the arrows used in the assassination, which were made from bone and extremely well-crafted. They speculate that the arrows could have been made by a skilled assassin, possibly from a distant part of the continent. 

The characters also consider who might benefit from a war between two regions, Lauren and Gilder, and discuss the possibility of a vendetta against Princess's rich father. However, they dismiss this idea as too far-fetched. 

The session ends with the characters still trying to piece together the clues and understand the motives behind the assassination.
In this role-playing game session, the characters, including Bo and Specter, engage in a tense encounter with a spy from the kingdom's spy network. The spy was disguised as a caterer at an event the characters were attending. After a violent confrontation, the characters manage to subdue the spy and attempt to interrogate him. Bo, who has telepathic abilities, tries to penetrate the spy's mind but is blocked by a mental wall. 

Specter then communicates with the spy using Thieves' Cant, a secret language known among thieves. The spy reveals that the king had received information about a potential threat to someone important to him. The event was a trap to confirm the validity of the threat. The spy also hints that they were aware of the characters' reputation and capabilities. 

After the interrogation, the characters untie the spy and let him go, with Specter expressing a belief that they will meet again. The spy blends back into the crowd seamlessly, demonstrating his professional skills. The characters are left with the knowledge that the threat to the kingdom is real and that the spy network is highly skilled and prepared. 

Meanwhile, another character plans to transform into the spy in a future heist, taking note of his nondescript appearance. The characters also discuss the spy's ability to block telepathic intrusion, indicating that the spy network is prepared for such tactics. 

The session ends with the characters reflecting on the encounter, acknowledging the skill of the spy network, and planning their next moves.
In this session, the characters continue to investigate the assassination attempt at the Archbishop's ceremony. They deduce that the assassins were targeting someone important to the king, and mistakenly thought Princess Popplestone was this person. The group realizes that the assassins were likely aiming for Valentina, the king's spymaster, and that the attack was a test to confirm their information source.

The group also discusses their upcoming casino job. They learn from their spy, Nugget, that an agent they sent into the casino has not returned, indicating the high level of security and danger associated with the job. However, Nugget also reports that the city of Riga, where the casino is located, seems to have lax information security, which could be advantageous for them.

Meanwhile, Martin, the scientist working on the fragments of the fallen star, is making progress. He believes he is close to locating one or two more fragments and expresses a desire to retrieve them. The group agrees to escort him when the time comes.

The characters also plan to visit Riga before the casino job to gather more information and complete side quests. They have a week before they need to leave, giving them time to prepare and strategize.
In this game session, the characters are planning a heist on a casino in the city of Riga. They are briefed about the key players in the city, including the Queen, the head of the archive, and the head of the clock. The characters are also informed about the bank's interests and the potential repercussions of their failed spy mission at the casino.

Daria, a supplier, visits the characters at their castle with a variety of magical items sourced from the guild, all designed to aid in the heist. These items include a scroll of wrist pocket, lock links (cufflinks that can produce thieves' tools and unlock non-magical locks), key coins (coins that can unlock any lock, including magical ones, for a short period), a potion of aqueous form (which can turn the drinker into water for 10 minutes), and barking stones (stones that emit a dog barking sound when thrown, useful for distractions). 

The characters are informed that they will owe Daria three and a half percent of their take from the heist, plus the cost of the items. The session ends with the characters contemplating their plan for the heist, with the understanding that it could potentially be accomplished without any dice rolls, challenging the players rather than their character sheets.
In this session, the group continues their planning for the heist at Riga Springs Casino. They meet with Daria, a member of the Clock, who provides them with various magical items to aid in their mission. These include key coins, lock links, barking stones, a wand of limited magic detection, and a foliage seed. The group decides to take all the items, despite the cost, as they believe it will be beneficial for their mission. 

Daria also offers them a short-term loan of 250 gold pieces, with a 20% interest rate per month. The group agrees to this, seeing it as a necessary expense for their mission. They now owe Daria 660 gold pieces in total, including the cost of the magical items. 

Daria also suggests they visit Luca in Riga, who might have a disguise kit or other useful items. However, she warns them that Luca will likely ask for something in return. 

The group also discusses their strategy for the heist. They consider sending in some members to play casually at the casino, but realize that the exclusive nature of the casino would make this difficult. They decide to arrive a few days early to scope out the place. 

Finally, they discuss a side mission to clear out a group of renegade goblins that have taken over a key crossing point at the choke. They decide to send their secondary characters on this mission, seeing it as a good opportunity for them to gain experience. The group decides to tackle this mission in the next session, before proceeding with the heist.
The group discussed the potential fate of a character who might have been captured. They debated whether they should attempt a rescue, considering the character's apparent incompetence as a spy. They concluded that if a spy gets caught, they're not very good at their job, and it might be better to let them face the consequences. The group decided to end the session and reconvene next week, ready to introduce their secondary characters and engage in combat. They also agreed to start a thread to remind each other of their secondary characters' roles and actions. The session ended on a light-hearted note, with the group joking about their characters being "meat sacks."
