archbishops knew catacombs were bad so blocked it The Skull was a powerful servant of Orcus and the ritual would have returned him to spread orcus funk THE PAPERS Confirm that the Chantry is built on some sort of leyline or font of power Leylines aren t really well understood or studied there could be plenty that people are not aware of or locations that people THINK are leylines but actually aren t But the Chantry location is as confirmed as it can be The Dawnfather potentially consecrated this location himself before the gods removed themselves from the world There are multiple layers underground more than what you saw Temples have been built and torn down there for over a thousand years Apparently the old invading orcs worshipped Orcus Or at least the ones there did And prior Archbishops knew about the catacombs and about the skull If not specifically then in stories and references The skull which isn t given a name in the papers was apparently a powerful servant of Orcus If the probably ritual was performed and the necessary amount of blood provided the servant would return in full free to spread Orcus s gift of undeath There are notes in the margin presumably from the Archbishop It seems he was called down here in some manner He thought the Dawnfather was trying to tell him something To destroy the skull before it could be used for great evil The Archbishop seemed to believe that something terrible was coming He came down here for weeks between his duties never staying for too long because of the necromantic energy The last note says he found the skull

In this session of the role-playing game, the team returns to Castle Wren after a successful mission. They are greeted by their head scout, Hawthorne, who introduces them to Feather, a half-elf guard who has joined their company. This addition increases their scout corps level to one. 

Later, Rock, the lieutenant, has a conversation with Commander Valiant about the future of their company, Genesis Gambit. They discuss the need for discipline among their ranks and the potential challenges of attracting attention as they grow in power. Valiant expresses her confidence in Rock's leadership abilities.

The team then discusses how to allocate their resources. They decide to invest 100 gold pieces into their fence network, which will pay off on every job they undertake in the future. They also invest 200 gold pieces into establishing a spy network in Muscovar, a rich city where they have contacts and potential plot hooks. They decide to keep the remaining 261 gold pieces for future needs.

During a training session, Grim, one of the team members, is approached by Blue, a young water genasi. Blue asks Grim if he knows when he will be able to go home, as promised by Commander Valiant. Grim promises to inquire about it.
In this session, the characters continue their interactions with the members of their company. Rock and Valiant discuss the company's finances and decide to invest in a fence network in Muscovado. Rock also has a conversation with Blue, a water genasi who is feeling homesick and wants to return to his home in Quintessence. However, the only known portal to Quintessence is located in the dangerous Plane of Fire, making it nearly impossible for Blue to return home. 

The characters also participate in a town event called the Lamentation of the Lost, a holiday dedicated to remembering those who gave their lives in service to others. During the event, Specter and Boa notice Valiant clutching a small purple glove, which they later learn belonged to her deceased sister. 

Later, Hawthorne, a member of the company, approaches Eldren and asks him why he left the forest. Eldren explains that he felt a disturbance in the natural order of things and felt compelled to leave his home to address this issue. 

Towards the end of the session, the characters decide to purchase healing potions from Daria, a local merchant. They also discuss the performance of Daria's nephew, who managed to survive a dangerous mission due to his lack of ambition.
In this session of the Genesis Gambit campaign, the party spent their downtime in various activities. Rock and Eldrin focused on training and improving their skills, while Bo spent his time translating and interpreting the papers he found in the catacombs of the Chantry. 

The papers revealed that the Chantry was built on a ley line or font of power, consecrated by the Dawn Father himself. The catacombs were built by orcs who worshipped Orcus, and the skull they found was a powerful servant of Orcus. The Archbishop believed he was called to destroy the skull, but was possessed before he could do so. 

Meanwhile, the political landscape of the Broken Kingdom changed. The disappearances in Granite Hills were solved, and the village turned to Kazan for leadership. Muscovar renewed trade agreements with the Hill Dwarves of Oldguard, and the Priory of the Lake assumed control of the Chantry of Dawn. News of Genesis Gambit's heroic defense of a caravan spread through the Riverlands, but their association with a dead Archbishop generated mixed feelings. 

The party also made some investments, purchasing healing potions and securing options for future purchases. They also received updates on the political map, showing the shifting zones of control among the various factions. 

The session ended with the party waiting for their scout network to return with new job opportunities.
In this role-playing game session, the characters are visited by a man named Martin Broadcloak, a cosmologist from the Academy in Baku. Martin tells them about a shooting star he observed that exploded in the sky, with a fragment landing on a farm south of Dresden. He explains that the people and livestock on the farm have become sick and crazed, and strange, unnatural growths have appeared. Martin requests the characters' help in retrieving the star fragment and dealing with the situation on the farm.

The characters agree to help, with Eldren, a Circle of Stars Druid, showing particular interest in the cosmic event. Martin offers a diplomat's pouch, a valuable item that allows communication with high-ranking individuals, as payment for their services. The characters negotiate for additional compensation in the form of a future favor.

The group decides to travel to the farm, with Martin accompanying them. As they approach the farm, they notice signs of the unnatural phenomena Martin described, such as plants appearing dry and brittle or overgrown, and water sources appearing fouled. The session ends as they enter the affected region.
The group, consisting of Specter, Grim, Rock, Eldrin, and Bo, along with their guide Martin, approach a farmstead where a star fragment is believed to be located. The area is eerily silent and the landscape is unnaturally distorted, with a pumpkin patch growing out of season. As they approach the well where the fragment is supposed to be, two gray, lifeless figures, presumably once farmers, emerge from the house and attack.

Specter takes the lead box from Eldrin and attempts to cover the fragment, which appears to be a crumbling piece of rock with a divot where something once was. The farmers attack Grim, but their attacks miss. Grim retaliates by casting Gust of Wind, attempting to push the farmers back, but they resist the force of the wind. Rock then steps in, slashing one of the farmers into dust with a powerful attack.

Eldrin attempts to hit the remaining farmer with a Guiding Bolt spell, but misses. He then moves to inspect the well, finding a swirling mass of color at the bottom, suggesting that the fragment might have been thrown down there. Meanwhile, Bo, who had cast invisibility on himself earlier, decides to maintain his invisibility and enters the house to scout for more enemies.
In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party continues their battle against the mutated livestock and farmers. Specter, feeling heroic, decides to jump into the well where the meteorite is believed to be. Despite taking some damage, he successfully retrieves a small, hard object from the bottom of the well, which he believes to be the meteorite, and places it in a lead box.

Meanwhile, an enormous, swirling color, described as an Aurora Borealis, emerges from the well and hovers over the battlefield. It begins to sing a discordant song that resonates with Rock, causing him to sway and become entranced. The rest of the party, except for Bo, are forced to make wisdom saving throws to resist the song's effects. Eldrin, Danny, and Grimbore successfully resist, becoming immune to the song for the rest of the encounter. Bo, however, finds the song beautiful and is not affected.

Grimbore attacks one of the farmers, severely wounding him, and then uses his action surge to attack one of the mutated animals. Rock, under the influence of the song, stands motionless and does not take any actions. Eldrin prepares to cast Thunderwave on the approaching enemies. The session ends with the party still in the midst of battle, facing both the mutated creatures and the mysterious singing entity.
In this session of the role-playing game, the characters are engaged in a battle against a large, ethereal entity referred to as the "Aurora Borealis" and a group of hostile farmers and livestock. 

Grimgor, one of the characters, uses his wind spell to push back three of the farmers, causing minor damage. He then moves closer to the enemy, bringing the wind with him. He also successfully attacks and eliminates one of the farmers. 

Eldred, another character, drinks wine from his magic amulet, which heals him. He attempts to attack the Aurora Borealis with a guiding bolt but fails. 

Bo, who is invisible, attacks the Aurora Borealis with a hand crossbow and a psychic dagger. The dagger seems to cause significant damage to the entity, suggesting it might be vulnerable to psychic attacks. However, the Aurora Borealis retaliates, causing Bo significant cold and fire damage. 

Specter, who has been at the bottom of a well, climbs out and joins the battle. He successfully attacks one of the farmers with a sneak attack, causing damage. 

The Aurora Borealis moves and attempts to attack Bo again, causing more damage. The farmers also attack, causing damage to Rock, another character. 

The session ends with the characters still engaged in the battle.
In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party faced off against a mysterious entity known as "The Color." The encounter was triggered when Specter jumped into a well to retrieve a diamond, causing the entity to emerge. The Color had a hypnotic song that caused confusion and fear among the party and the livestock in the area. 

The party fought against The Color and the livestock, which had turned aggressive. The Color had the ability to reach out and attack, but it missed several times. The party managed to deal significant damage to The Color, with Eldren dealing 46 points of damage. The Color's song changed in response to the damage, turning mournful as it began to disperse and fill the sky like an aurora borealis before disappearing completely. 

The party was then able to quickly dispatch the remaining aggressive livestock. They found that The Color had not been killed, but had chosen to leave the encounter. The party also discovered a pyramid-shaped artifact in the mud, which they retrieved.

Throughout the encounter, the party made strategic use of their abilities. Grimgor used his Fey Knight ability to teleport and move the wind, which proved to be very effective in controlling the battlefield. Specter used his sneak attack to deal damage, while Eldren used his Thunder Wave and Archer Arrow of Radiance abilities. Bo used his psychic weapon to deal damage.

At the end of the session, the party leveled up to level 4. They discussed whether to choose feats or ability score improvements, with Grimgor deciding to become a weapon master.
