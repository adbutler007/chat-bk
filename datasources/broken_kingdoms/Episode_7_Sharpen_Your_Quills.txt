The group returned to Castle Wren after their encounter at the farm, where they had successfully captured the star fragment. Martin Broadcloak, the astrologer, was pleased with the outcome and expressed interest in studying the fragment further. He also mentioned that there might be more fragments scattered across the area. 

Upon their return, they met Holly Honeyholt, the matriarch of the Honeyholt Acres Farm, who was discussing an opportunity with Valiant, their commander. Holly suggested that the group should focus on bigger tasks while the rank and file members of Genesis Gambit took care of patrolling the road. 

During their stay at Castle Wren, Bo and Valiant spent days writing letters to various contacts, announcing the arrival of Genesis Gambit and their readiness for mercenary work. 

A messenger from the Chantry arrived with a box and a letter from Bishop Zorian, expressing gratitude for the group's assistance at the Chantry. The box contained a Chantry Lantern, a magical item that could ward off undead creatures when lit with holy water. The group decided to keep the lantern, with Elgin volunteering to carry it. 

Bishop Zorian also invited the group to his ascension ceremony to the position of Archbishop, with the date to be announced later.
During this session, the characters are at their castle when Bo, the castle's spymaster, notices that someone has been snooping around. The intruder has not stolen or damaged anything, but has been looking through personal items in Bo and Valiant's rooms. Bo sets up traps to catch the intruder, but instead finds a smiley face drawn in the flour he had sprinkled on the floor, indicating that the intruder is aware of his attempts. 

Valiant suspects that the intruder is Valentina, the spymaster of Baku, who is known for her extensive spy network. They decide to invest in their own spy network in Baku to counteract this threat, leaving them with only 26 gold. They also decide to run an operation against Baku to find out more about the city's political situation and objectives. Bo rolls a nine for this operation. 

Meanwhile, Specter receives a message that Daria, a local merchant, has new items in stock. Specter, Valiant, and Eldrin visit Daria's shop where she shows them a potion of healing, a scroll of feather, and a magical greatsword that was involved in some drama. Daria offers one of the items for free as a token of appreciation for their business partnership. The characters have yet to decide which item to choose.
The group receives a letter from the Bank of Riga, offering them a job to carry out a strategic initiative near the ruins of Saratov. The job promises a flat fee of 500 gold, but the group suspects they are being lowballed. They decide to wait for other responses before making a decision.

A few days later, a rider arrives at Castle Rand from Kazimir Kulik, the master of the Spices Guild in Muscov. The rider, a severe-looking woman, requests a private meeting with the group. She reveals that a group of journeymen carrying a special order through a dangerous mountain pass has gone missing. The group is offered 50 gold for each journeyman found dead and 150 gold for each found alive. A bonus will also be given if the item they were transporting is found and returned.

The group learns that the mountain pass is heavily patrolled and dangerous, with access points to the Underdark. The woman urges the group to venture forth as soon as possible to find the missing journeymen. The group is left to decide their next course of action.
In this session, the group receives three job offers. The first is from the Bank of Riga, who needs them to investigate a potential threat in Saratov within two weeks. The second is from Casimir, who needs them to rescue four men trapped in the city of Brass Gate within three days. The third is from Gorek Karuskan, headmaster of the Iron Monastery, who needs them for an urgent and dangerous task, but provides no further details.

After some deliberation, the group decides to accept the first two jobs and reject the third. They plan to rescue the men in Brass Gate first, then head to Saratov to fulfill the Bank's request. They believe this plan will allow them to complete both tasks within the given timeframes.

During their journey, they encounter a group of feral goblins at a crucial crossing point known as the Choke. Despite the potential threat these goblins pose to future travelers, the group decides to ignore them and continue on their journey due to their tight schedule.
In this role-playing game session, the characters are traveling on a quiet road through flat plains and dry scrubland, heading towards the larger lake towns from Raventree. Suddenly, the earth rumbles beneath them, and a massive insect-like creature bursts from the ground. The characters, Specter, Bo, Grim, and Eldrim, along with a journeyman, engage in a battle with the creature.

Specter strikes first, dealing a significant amount of damage. The creature retaliates by attacking Danny Druid, causing substantial harm. The journeyman struggles to control her frightened horse, and Specter attempts to help but fails, causing the horse to panic further.

Bo uses his kinetic ability to push the creature back and then shoots at it, causing it to bleed acidic blood. The creature then burrows underground, disappearing from sight. The characters spread out and hold their actions, waiting for the creature to reemerge.

When the creature does reemerge, it pulls Bo underground. Despite being in a difficult situation, Bo manages to wound the creature severely with his rapier before climbing out of the hole. Grim moves closer to the hole, ready to engage the creature when it surfaces again.

Eldrim jumps into the hole to confront the creature, hitting it with a guiding bolt and dealing radiant damage. The creature is now marked, making it easier for the next attack to hit. The session ends with Eldrim in the hole, facing the creature.
In this session of the Dungeons and Dragons campaign, the party, consisting of Grim, Eldrin, Specter, and Bo, continue their journey westward. They are accompanied by Journeyman, a dangerous woman with poor animal handling skills. 

The party starts by discussing their next steps and deciding to take on two jobs. The first job involves investigating a missing person, while the second job is about a mysterious message from a messenger. The party decides to take on both jobs, with Eldrin taking the lead in the investigation of the missing person. 

As they travel, the party encounters a monstrous creature called an ankheg. The creature emerges from the ground and attacks the party. Grim, who had held his action, attacks the ankheg with his battle ax, dealing damage but also taking acid damage from the creature's wounds. The ankheg then sprays acid all around it, causing significant damage to the party. 

Specter throws his short sword at the ankheg, dealing a fatal blow. The creature collapses, spraying a final burst of acid that injures Grim. With the ankheg defeated, Eldrin emerges from his hiding place and uses his healing abilities to restore the party's health. He casts Healing Word on Bo, who had been incapacitated, and also heals Grim and Specter. 

With their health restored, the party decides to continue their journey. They discuss the possibility of taking a short rest, but decide to press on. The session ends with the party continuing their journey westward, ready to face whatever challenges lie ahead.
