In the last session, the team completed their journey to the bank job, also known as the Seratov job. They bypassed a two-headed ogre and arrived at the location where they were greeted by an arrogant human knight, Sir Percival Hawkins, Lieutenant of the Silver Suns, another mercenary organization. They also met Titus Prolix, the chief of staff to the chairwoman of the Bank of Riga, and four of his bodyguards. The team's friendly mercenary company, the Barrel Men, left during the night to deal with a giant in their hometown.

The team began the bank job the next morning, entering the city to retrieve a small iron cauldron from an underground chamber in one of the hills of the city. They encountered a strange puddle of blood and were attacked by tree-like creatures. During the fight, a ghost of a hobgoblin man appeared and observed the battle.

After the fight, the team noticed the ghost and began to interact with him. Danny revealed that he had been talking to ghosts, which surprised the rest of the team. They decided to question the ghost about the whereabouts of the cauldron and any potential dangers they should be aware of.

The team also discussed their strategy for exploring the city. They considered the possibility of avoiding fights to conserve resources and complete the job more quickly. They also discussed the potential benefits of splitting up the party to cover more ground. The team decided to continue exploring the city, but to be mindful of potential dangers and to prioritize finding the cauldron over engaging in unnecessary fights.
The party, consisting of Rock, Elgin, Grim, and their ghostly hobgoblin guide, continue their journey through the ruined city. The ghost leads them safely, avoiding various hazards such as puddles of blood and unstable buildings. Along the way, the ghost reveals that he doesn't remember his past or his name, and hopes that their journey will help him rediscover his identity. 

The party eventually arrives at a ruined stone building filled with skeletal remains. The ghost points out a painting on the wall, which is a portrait of him. Elgin straightens the painting, revealing the full image of the ghost in his former life. 

Meanwhile, Grim investigates one of the skeletons and discovers that it was wearing a suit of splint armor, which could be valuable if repaired. He also notices an engraving on the armor's shoulder guards - two dice and a stylized 'G', the symbol of the old company, Gambit. This discovery suggests that the skeletons might be the remains of the previous company that ventured into the city. 

The party decides to continue following the ghost, despite the potential risks, as they believe he can lead them to the statue garden they are seeking.
The team, consisting of Bo, Trigger, Eldrin, Rock, and Grim, found themselves in a ruined city, where they encountered the ghost of King Toss Rabbits, the last king of Saratov. The ghost was unaware of his past and the team helped him remember by showing him his portrait. They also discovered the skeletons of the original Genesis Gambit team, who had been killed by physical violence. Among the remains, they found a clean brass bracelet and some armor, which they took with them.

The ghost warned them about his "lesser cousins" who were not as friendly as him. Suddenly, ghostly figures, including smudges of shadow and two more substantial figures, appeared, initiating a combat situation. The team decided to retreat down an alleyway, with Bo and Trigger casting mirror image on themselves for protection. Eldrin managed to eliminate one of the substantial figures (A) with a Guiding Bolt, dealing 14 points of radiant damage, and also damaged the other one (B) with a Starry Form Archer attack.

However, the surviving figure (B) retaliated by casting a spell that created a pitch-black, freezing darkness around Rock, Grim, and Eldrin. Rock managed to stumble out of the darkness and prepared to attack any minions that approached him. Grim also managed to walk out of the darkness and could see figure B, but not his friends. The session ended with the team preparing to continue the fight against the ghostly figures.
The group continues their battle against the shadowy creatures in the haunted house. Beau, Trigger, and Grim are all surrounded by the creatures and are forced to make wisdom saving throws due to the oppressive presence of the creatures. Beau fails his saving throw and becomes frightened, while Trigger and Grim manage to resist the fear. 

Eldren uses the Chantry Lantern filled with holy water, which causes the shadow creatures to become less substantial and take damage. The lantern's light also gives the creatures disadvantage on their attack rolls. Eldren then uses his Starry Form to attack one of the larger shadow creatures, successfully killing it and causing the darkness it was creating to disappear. 

Trigger uses his magic missiles to attack the shadow creatures, managing to kill two of them. Rock attempts to use Shocking Grasp on the creatures but misses. Grim, despite being frightened, manages to kill six of the shadow creatures with a single swing of his glaive. 

On their turn, the shadow creatures are destroyed by the radiant light from the Chantry Lantern. However, two more substantial looking creatures appear from the dark corners of the room. Eldren's lantern damages them as well, but they manage to blur and become more insubstantial, blending in with their surroundings. The group prepares to continue the fight against these new threats.
The group, guided by the ghostly child Toss, continues their journey through the ruined city. They encounter two ghostly figures, which Toss identifies as the spirits of adults who died in the city. The group engages in a battle with these spirits, who have the ability to pass through them, causing a feeling of decay and necrotic damage. The spirits also have the ability to disappear and reappear at will. Despite the spirits' resistance to their attacks, the group manages to defeat them.

After the battle, the group decides to continue their journey without taking a short rest, using healing potions to restore their health instead. Toss leads them to a hill, where they find a ruined wall and a bubbling spring. Toss points out an archway leading into the hill, identifying it as the entrance to the statue garden they are seeking. However, he refuses to go any further.

As the group enters the statue garden, they hear a voice in their heads demanding payment in the form of their hopes and dreams. When Rock, one of the group members, questions what they should pay with, the voice demands their dreams. Eldrin, the group's bard, attempts to appease the voice by playing a song on his lute, but the voice demands the instrument itself. When Rock offers his dreams, he feels a powerful force rifling through his mind, seemingly satisfied with what it finds. The session ends with the voice still present in Rock's mind.
In this session of the role-playing game, the characters continue their journey through a mysterious garden, where they encounter a voice that demands they give up their hopes. Each character offers up a deeply personal hope, which is violently ripped from them, causing them to suffer two levels of exhaustion and various amounts of psychic damage. 

Eldren notices a statue that seems to have moved, and upon attacking it, both he and Grimm suffer additional exhaustion and psychic damage. The voice then demands Eldren to give up his hope, which he does, resulting in his glass star charts cracking in half. 

The group then enters a chamber with a large brazier and an altar with a handprint indentation. They notice hundreds of bat-like creatures hanging from the ceiling, which are attracted to light. When the creatures, which look like hands with wings, come into contact with the light from Eldren's flame and Rock's sword, they absorb the light and cause it to flicker out. 

Triggerino comes up with a plan to cast light on the handprint indentation on the altar, hoping to attract one of the creatures. Grimm leads Triggerino to the altar due to Triggerino's inability to see in the dark. Triggerino casts the light spell and steps aside, waiting to see if one of the creatures will be drawn to the light.
The group successfully retrieves a small cauldron, two scrolls (Alarm and Knock), and a vial of gold liquid from a hidden alcove. They decide to leave the city quickly, guided by the ghost, Toss. Toss requests them to find out about his past life as a king and share the information with him. 

As they approach a bridge to exit the city, they encounter Sir Percival Hawkins from the Silver Suns mercenary company. He proposes a non-lethal competition for the cauldron, threatening a fight to the death if they refuse. The group considers various strategies, including using magic to intimidate or deceive Hawkins, destroying the bridge, or sneaking around to another crossing. 

They also contemplate accepting the competition, but worry about the limitations of non-lethal magic. The group is yet to decide on their course of action.
In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party, consisting of Eldrin, Grim, Beau, Rock, and Trigger, continue their quest to retrieve a cauldron for Titus Prolix. They find themselves in a ruined city, where they encounter a group of soldiers led by Sir Percival. The soldiers demand the cauldron, but the party refuses, leading to a tense standoff.

Eldrin, in an attempt to avoid combat, uses his druidic abilities to create an illusion of the cauldron. The party then tries to deceive the soldiers into believing they are giving up the cauldron and leaving. Trigger uses his minor illusion spell to make a bag of sand look like the cauldron, and Beau helps sell the deception with a convincing speech. The soldiers are fooled, and one of them is sent to retrieve the "cauldron".

Meanwhile, Eldrin, disguised as a warhorse, makes a break for it, heading towards Titus Prolix with the real cauldron. The rest of the party also starts to flee, but when the soldier realizes the cauldron is an illusion, the chase begins.

The party uses various spells and tactics to slow down the soldiers. Trigger casts a web spell to entangle some of them, Beau uses a grease spell to make the ground slippery, and Grim uses gust of wind to propel the party forward and slow down the pursuers. Rock even enlists the help of a ghost, who scares some of the soldiers.

Eventually, the party manages to lose the soldiers and make it back to camp, where Eldrin is already relaxing with Titus Prolix. The party has successfully completed their mission, and they look forward to a period of downtime and the rewards of their successful deception and escape.
