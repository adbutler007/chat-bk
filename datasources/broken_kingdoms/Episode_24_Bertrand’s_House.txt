The party wakes up in the Gilded Lily, a luxurious hotel in the city, after a long rest. Rock discovers that the eye on the back of his head, a symptom of the gibbering mouther's disease, has disappeared. Bo, looking through the Chronicle, finds references to gibbering mouthers and learns that those affected by their reality-warping abilities can turn into gibbering mouthers over time. 

Valiant, the party's commander, is already downstairs for breakfast. She advises the party that they don't need to accept every job offer they receive in the city and should consider what they want to accomplish. She suggests they take advantage of their reputation and recruit more members for their operations. 

Valiant also tasks Trigger with completing Martin's work on locating the third star fragment, as the previous two have been associated with strange occurrences. She mentions that access to the city's Mages Guild would require approval from one of the other guilds. 

For Bo, Valiant suggests strengthening their spy network in the city, potentially finding someone to lead their operations or infiltrating the journeyman to steal information. She proposes waiting for reports from their scouts in Moscow and Baku before making any decisions. 

Lastly, Valiant suggests to Eldrin that they send their scout corps back on the roads to investigate the recent attacks, as they might be of little use in the city. She suspects that some of the jobs they receive might send them back on the road.
The team discusses their next steps in the city of Muscathar. Specter suggests making contact with the head of the clock's operations, a figure known as the Eel. They also consider reestablishing contact with Casimir, a powerful figure in the city who might be able to help them source useful items. Valiant decides to stay behind for a lunch meeting with Lady Shiona Silverlight, the master of the Metalworkers Guild, while the rest of the team accompanies Constable Cadbury to question Albert Wilmarth, a friend of Bertrand, the composer involved in the mysterious theater incident.

At the bookstore owned by Albert, they learn that Bertrand was a deeply troubled individual who found solace in music. Albert reveals that Bertrand could be easily misled outside of his musical expertise, suggesting that he might have been swept up in the occult activities at the theater. Albert also mentions two unfamiliar names from the playbill of Bertrand's last opera, Ramsey and the Stranger, the latter of whom was cast in a premier role. The team is left with more questions about the plot of the opera and the identities of these two individuals.
The party, consisting of Elgin, Bo, and Trigger, along with Constable Cadbury, continue their investigation into the mysterious playwright Bertrand. They visit Albert, a bookkeeper and friend of Bertrand, who provides them with valuable information. Albert reveals that Bertrand was always secretive about his plays and would lock himself away while writing. He also mentions that Bertrand was particularly excited about his latest play, which he considered his magnum opus. 

Albert also reveals that Bertrand had been working with a man named Ramsey, which was unusual as Bertrand typically worked alone. He also mentions a third friend, Kers, a stonemason. Albert provides the party with the addresses of both Bertrand and Kers. 

During their conversation, Albert recognizes the party's name, Genesis Gambit, and is surprised to see them, believing they had been destroyed. He reveals that he has a portion of the group's chronicle, which he purchased from a halfling named Jester Greenhill several years ago. Albert offers to give the chronicle to the party if they can find Bertrand alive. 

The party then decides to have lunch in the city's red-light district, Hounds, hoping to gather more information. Cadbury, however, excuses himself due to his position as a constable. He suggests they meet later at Kers' house. Before parting ways, Cadbury reveals that he and Valiant, a member of Genesis Gambit, had worked together in the past and he wanted to ensure the party was trustworthy. He then hints at a potential job offer for the party.
The group of characters, including Cadbury, a senior constable, discuss a potential job involving a series of warehouses occupied by smugglers. The owners of the warehouses and the constable area have been trying to negotiate with the smugglers to leave, but to no avail. Some parties want to continue negotiations, while others want to forcibly evict the smugglers. Cadbury offers the group this job, which would be paid under the table, and stresses that no one can know it came from the constable area. 

The group discusses the risk of the mission, noting that the smugglers are effective and dangerous. They also find it strange that the smugglers have taken over a warehouse in the city, as smugglers usually keep to the islands off the coast. The warehouse belongs to the Stonemasons Guild, who have been unable to remove the smugglers. 

The group debates whether to take the job, considering the potential political implications within the city. They also consider other tasks, such as investigating Bertrand's house, a crime scene. They decide to go to Bertrand's house first, as they believe the smugglers are not going anywhere in the short term. The group plans to tackle the warehouse situation later.
The group, consisting of Elgin, Chick, Specter, Trigger, and Bo, continue their investigation in the city of Easleton, which is described as a gentrified district. They arrive at Bertrand's house, a two-story Victorian-style home in the affluent part of the district, around 4 PM. The house is under guard by constables, but no one has entered it yet. 

Upon entering, they find themselves in a spacious foyer leading to a salon and a series of other rooms. The salon is neat and organized, with a pile of newspapers on the coffee table. Specter picks up the top newspaper and finds it dated for the next day, with a front-page story about the events that happened in the theater. The second newspaper contains a record of every conversation the group has had since they arrived in Muscovar, ending with their conversation with Cadbury before entering the house. 

The group conducts several experiments to understand the nature of the newspapers, but the content remains unchanged. They decide to pocket the newspapers and continue their exploration. 

Trigger, while investigating for traps, disturbs a patch of black mold in the Butler pantry, causing him to become poisoned. The group then moves on to the kitchen, which is in stark contrast to the salon, being a complete mess with pots, pans, and rotting food everywhere. 

On the swinging door between the kitchen and the dining room, they find a cryptic message written in oil paint: "Words can so easily glide over mayhem and terror and horror. It's a wonder trust exists at all." The paint is dry, indicating it's not very old. 

In the kitchen, Bo lifts a pot lid to find a soup filled with left thumbs, causing a sense of horror among the group. Despite the disturbing discoveries, they decide to continue their investigation.
The group continues their investigation in Bertrand's house. They first explore the dining room, where they find a large table with life-size marionettes seated around it. Each marionette has a bronze name tag, six of which bear the group's names. The other four marionettes are labeled "The Stranger," "The Herald," "Bertrand," and one with a painted crown, presumably representing "The Last King." 

Next, they move to Bertrand's study, which is in chaos with torn papers and discarded sheet music. They find playbills identical to those they saw in the theater. Despite the mess, they don't find any significant clues. 

The group then decides to explore the basement, where they are met with a strong smell and a sight of black mold covering the walls. They quickly retreat after realizing the mold is toxic, causing them to suffer poison damage. 

Upstairs, they find three rooms. The first room they enter is Bertrand's bedroom, which is messy but not trashed. The group notices a strange smell coming from the bed. Upon investigation, they discover black spores puffing out from the mattress. 

In the midst of this, Bo notices something large in Grimm's pocket. Grimm pulls out a cream-colored envelope containing a beautifully hand-printed invitation addressed to him. The invitation is for a masquerade ball celebrating the birthday of Casilda, Queen of the Royal Court of Carcosa, a character from the play. The event is scheduled for a week from the current date. 

The group then moves on to the next room, which turns out to be an artist's studio. The session ends without any further significant discoveries.
The group continues their exploration of Bertrand's house, starting with the basement. They find a room filled with paintings, including one of a woman who looks like a younger version of the woman in the portrait upstairs. The painting is signed by Bertrand, suggesting he might be older than he appears. They also find a painting of a landscape with a figure in the middle, which triggers a memory in Specter. The figure in the painting is Specter himself, and the painting is the same one from his dream. The initials "RF" are found at the bottom of the painting, which they connect to Ramsey Forest, the co-author of a book they found earlier. 

In another room, they find a plant that has gone insane, screaming when they try to communicate with it. The bed in the room appears to have been slept in recently. 

Throughout the house, they find various quotes and writings that seem to hint at some deeper meaning or connection, but they struggle to piece it all together. They decide to compile all the quotes and clues they've found for further analysis. 

The group ends their exploration of the house without encountering Bertrand. They discuss their next steps, considering whether to take on the warehouse job or check in with Valiant. They decide to take their time and weigh their options. 

The session ends with the group still poisoned from a previous encounter, and planning to regroup and decide on their next move.
