The group of adventurers, consisting of Nugget, a halfling rogue, Frankie Fighter, a human fighter, Viserion, a gold dragonborn sorcerer, and Michelangelo, a tortle monk, are tasked with clearing out a strategic location known as the Choke from a tribe of unruly goblins. The Choke, a bridge with fortifications on either side, is a crucial point of control in the region. The goblins have been shaking down travelers and causing trouble.

Before they depart, a fellow mercenary named Knuckles gives them two healing potions for their journey. The group decides to approach the goblin-infested area stealthily, planning to scout the area before making any moves. They discuss their strategies, with some suggesting a direct assault while others propose creating a distraction.

Frankie Fighter and Viserion decide to create a distraction at the front gate, allowing the rest of the group to sneak in. They plan to wait for the others to get into position before they start their distraction. The group's plan is to clear out the goblins and secure the Choke for their mercenary company.
In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party approaches a fortified goblin outpost. Frankie Fighter and Gift act as a distraction, drawing the attention of two goblin guards on a bridge. Nugget, a rogue, stealthily climbs a wall and takes out a goblin on a tower with a well-aimed shot from his sharp bow. Viserion attempts to attack the goblins on the bridge but misses. The goblins retaliate, slashing at Frankie and Gift before retreating, calling for their comrade Fritz.

Gift casts Sanctuary on herself and taunts the goblins in their own language, trying to draw them back. Mikey the Turtle climbs the wall to get a better vantage point, while Jake, a druid, transforms into his starry form and attacks one of the goblins with a radiant arrow, but misses with a Guiding Bolt spell. An unseen goblin, presumably Fritz, shoots an arrow from a tower, hitting Jake.

Frankie chases after the retreating goblins, slashing one with his scimitar. Nugget moves under the bridge and takes out another goblin. Viserion moves to get a better line of sight on the remaining goblin. The session ends with the party preparing for their next moves.
The group of adventurers, consisting of Frankie, Mikey the Turtle, Jacob, Gift, and Bysserian, continue their exploration of a goblin-infested fortress. Frankie and Mikey manage to scale the fortress walls, with Frankie reaching the top of a tower and Mikey entering a second-floor room. Inside, Mikey discovers a giant, blue, frosty man, who appears to be unconscious and reeking of alcohol, strapped to a table. 

Meanwhile, the rest of the group, Gift, Jacob, and Bysserian, decide to take a more cautious approach and walk around the fortress. They enter the courtyard, noticing a large, fresh hole in the ground. As they approach a set of stairs leading to the second level, a giant spider with a platform on its back emerges from the hole. 

The group prepares for battle, with Nugget, Gift, Jacob, Mikey, Frankie, and Bysserian readying themselves in that order. The session ends with the group bracing for a fight against the giant spider.
In this Dungeons and Dragons game session, the characters are engaged in a battle with a giant spider. The spider initially charges at the group, managing to hit Viserion and Nugget, causing them damage. The group retaliates with a series of attacks. Nugget, after being hit, disengages and moves back to shoot at the spider, but misses. Gift, from a safe distance, successfully hits the spider with a firebolt. Jacob Vibranium also manages to hit the spider with a guiding bolt and a starry form archer attack. 

Mikey the Ninja Turtle, after a failed acrobatic stunt that resulted in him falling from a roof, recovers and launches a series of attacks on the spider using his nunchucks and claws, dealing significant damage. Frankie Fighter Deadpool, despite a failed initial attack, manages to climb onto the spider's back and lands a hit. Finally, Adam, deciding to go all out, successfully hits the spider with a firebolt. 

Throughout the session, the characters also interact with a sleeping frost giant, who is chained to a bench and does not pose an immediate threat. The characters make strategic decisions about their positions and movements, with some choosing to retreat or move to safer locations. The session ends with the spider severely injured but still alive.
In this session of the role-playing game, the team of adventurers, consisting of Frankie, Viserion, Nugget, Gift, Portnoy, and Ninja Turtle, continue their exploration of a goblin-infested area. They encounter a giant war spider, which they manage to defeat after a fierce battle, dealing a total of 73 points of damage in two rounds. 

After the battle, they discover a frost giant named Ragnar, son of Stormald, who is tied to a table. Ragnar claims to have partied with the goblins and asks the adventurers to release him, promising to help them kill the goblins. The team decides to leave him tied up until they've cleared out the remaining goblins.

The adventurers then proceed to a room where they encounter four goblins, including a female goblin queen named Parsnip. Despite their attempts to attack, the adventurers are met with resistance, and Frankie is severely injured and falls unconscious. Portnoy manages to revive him using a healing spell, but Frankie is soon knocked unconscious again by another goblin attack.

Meanwhile, Ninja Turtle performs an impressive acrobatic move, sliding down a table to attack a goblin. Despite the team's efforts, they are outnumbered, and the goblin queen uses her legendary action to call for reinforcements. The session ends with the adventurers in a precarious situation, facing a growing number of goblins.
In this session of the role-playing game, the players continue their battle against Queen Parsnip and her minions. The Queen manages to land a hit on Ninja Turtle (Mikey), but misses her other two attacks. Viserion, another player, retaliates with a Firebolt against the Queen, dealing minor damage. 

The Goblin Sniper attempts to attack Mikey but misses, while Frankie, who is down, makes successful death saving throws. Nugget, who is also close to being down, manages to kill a minion before disengaging and moving away from the fight. 

Gift, another player, initially plans to cast heroism on Frankie to give him temporary hit points, but realizes that it won't restore him to consciousness. Instead, Gift uses an action to feed Frankie a healing potion, restoring some of his hit points. 

Jacob Viburnum and Mikey both attack the enemies but deal minimal damage. At the end of the round, Queen Parsnip retreats, leaving her minions to continue the fight. The session ends with the players planning their next moves, with the expectation that they will easily dispatch the remaining lackeys in the next session.
