In this session of the role-playing game, the players discuss their current situation and plan their next moves. They start by reviewing recent events, including the expansion of territories on the map, the rising attacks on travelers, and the movements of various mercenary companies. They also discuss the departure of Martin, a character who left to the north with some of their former soldiers.

The players then discuss their finances, deciding to invest most of their 13,000 gold in various areas. They consider buying magic weapons, but realize that these are rare and difficult to acquire. They also discuss allocating their two new recruits, a hobgoblin ghost and a character named Blister.

Trigger, one of the players, has been experimenting with time and has made significant progress. He believes he can create a device that allows him to view the recent past for 500 gold. The group agrees to fund this, seeing potential benefits for espionage and investigation.

The group also discusses the locations of two star fragments, one in Muscovar and one near Riga. They consider trying to solve the location of the second fragment. They also discuss the possibility of a war between Baku and Muscovar, and the potential need to intervene if Baku continues to expand.

Finally, the group decides to spend 500 gold on spell components for Mike's character, which will allow him to summon beasts and fey creatures. They see this as a worthwhile investment, given the potential benefits in combat. The session ends with the group planning their next moves, including deciding which city to travel to next.
The players discussed their strategy for the game, focusing on how to best allocate their resources. They decided to spend their two recruits on the Scout and Spy networks, assigning Toss to the Scout network and Blister to the Spy network in Baku. They also decided to spend 250 gold pieces on a magic weapon for Grim, and discussed the potential benefits and drawbacks of this decision.

The players also discussed the potential of upgrading their Quartermaster and Weaponmaster networks. They decided to spend 1,000 gold on the Quartermaster network, and 2,600 gold on the Weaponmaster network. They also decided to spend 1,200 gold to get off the "shneid" (zero) for all the minor cities in the Spy network.

In addition, they decided to trade in a magic item, the Bumper Bangles, to upgrade their Scout network to level five. They also discussed the potential of trading in other magic items, such as the Wind Fan and the Emerald Pen, but ultimately decided against it.

Overall, the players made strategic decisions to strengthen their networks and resources, preparing for future challenges in the game. They prioritized upgrading their Scout, Spy, Quartermaster, and Weaponmaster networks, and discussed the potential benefits and drawbacks of their decisions.
In this session, the characters return to Castle Rend after their successful casino job. They learn about the events that transpired at the choke, including the appearance of Ragnar the Frost Giant and Blister the Goblin. The group then decides to invest heavily in their company, boosting morale among their ranks. They purchase horses for all senior officers, upgrade weapons and armor, and hire new drill sergeants for training. 

The group also discusses their financial situation, deciding to spend their remaining 6,344 gold on various upgrades. They decide to spend 1,200 gold on bumping each of the markets up to two, and another 1,200 gold on removing any disadvantages. They also decide to spend 1,000 gold each on Riga and Muscovar, leaving them with 2,144 gold. 

During this time, Blue, a water genasi, approaches Grim and expresses his desire to return home. Grim promises to look into it. Meanwhile, Trigger investigates the departure of Martin, the scientist, and discovers that the star fragment Martin was experimenting with no longer works. 

Trigger also conducts a thorough investigation of the castle to ensure there are no hidden devices or spells that could compromise their security. He finds nothing suspicious. As a precautionary measure, he decides to set up an alarm on Valiant's door each night. 

The group also discusses the possibility of expanding their ranks, anticipating that they could potentially recruit hundreds of new members once they reach a big city. They consider implementing a strict background check process to ensure the loyalty of their new recruits.
The group decides to focus their efforts on Muscovar, choosing to ignore the Blood Skulls for now. They discuss the possibility of using their newly enhanced spy network to gather information about Muscovar and the location of the shard. They also consider spreading their bets by rolling against multiple cities to gather more information about the ongoing conflicts between kingdoms.

They decide to roll against Baku, Muscovar, and Riga, with the aim of understanding the state of play in each city and whether they are planning or preparing for aggression. The group's character, who is highly proficient in deception, rolls a 29 against Baku, a 26 against Muscovar, and a 17 against Riga. They learn that Baku has the best spy network in the kingdoms, while Muscovar's is also quite good. The spy network in Riga is not as well-known.

Finally, the group decides to journey to Muscovar, with the entire company, Genesis Gambit, accompanying them. The decision is made with the understanding that the company's presence in Muscovar will play a crucial role in the progression of the game.
The group, consisting of Rock, Specter, Eldren, Bow, and Trigger, are traveling to Muscovar with their mercenary company, Genesis Gambit. They decide to send a scout team ahead to prepare for their arrival. On their journey, they encounter a foggy graveyard filled with undead creatures. 

Eldren uses his Entangle spell to restrain the enemies, but the cultist manages to save himself from the spell. Specter then attacks a ghoul, dealing significant damage. The cultist retaliates by casting a necrotic energy spell at Eldren, dealing a substantial amount of damage and leaving him teetering on the brink of collapse. The group prepares to continue the battle.
In this session of the role-playing game, the party continues their battle against a group of skeletons, ghouls, and a cultist. Eldran, in dragon form, attempts to cast Guiding Bolt on the cultist but misses twice, despite having advantage due to the effects of Faerie Fire. He then turns invisible and moves to a different location for cover. 

Specter successfully casts Faerie Fire on the cultist and a skeleton, giving the party advantage on attacks against them. He then moves back to his hiding spot. 

Rock, after deflecting a death bolt from the cultist with a shield, moves closer to the enemy and casts Witch Bolt, dealing six points of lightning damage. 

Bo, taking advantage of the Faerie Fire, shoots the cultist, dealing a significant 20 points of damage. 

Trigger attempts to attack the cultist but misses, despite having advantage. He then retreats behind a tree for cover. 

The skeletons attempt to attack Rock and Bo, with one managing to hit Bo for five points of damage. 

Grim uses his movement and Misty Step to get close to the cultist and attacks twice, dealing a total of 18 points of damage. 

The ghoul remains entangled and fails to free itself. 

The party continues to focus their efforts on taking down the cultist, with the skeletons and the ghoul posing less of a threat.
In this session of the Dungeons and Dragons game, the party continued their journey to Muskevar. They encountered a graveyard where they were attacked by a cultist and his undead minions. The cultist was an old human man who used necromantic energy to form a scythe from his staff. He also had the ability to resurrect the undead creatures the party killed, and heal himself using their life force.

The party focused their attacks on the cultist, realizing that killing the minions was only aiding him. Rock used Thunderwave to push the cultist and a skeleton away, causing the skeleton to fall apart. Bow continued to attack the cultist, dealing significant damage. Trigger finished off the cultist with a fire spell, causing all the undead creatures to collapse to dust.

After the battle, the party found a scythe that the cultist had been using. They decided to investigate it further in the next session. The session ended with the party looking forward to attending the debut of Bertrand Gileard's new opera, "The King in Yellow," in Muskevar.
