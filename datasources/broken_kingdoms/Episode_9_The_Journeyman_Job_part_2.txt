The group of adventurers, consisting of Rock, Eldren, Danny, and Trigger, are on a mission to find four missing journeymen in service to Kazimir Kulik of the Spicer's Guild. They have ascended a mountain and found a strange creature, a snow mutant monstrosity, which they defeated. They also discovered the body of one of the journeymen, a human man who died from exposure, missing both his teeth and tongue. 

In the tent used by the journeymen, they found normal travel gear and a polished box of volcanic rock containing hundreds of small paper baggies filled with a brownish, reddish sand. The sand, referred to as "essence of ember" in a note found with the box, is a potent spice from the City of Brass. The note warns that failure to thoroughly cook the spice can result in severe health issues. The group decides to keep some of the spice for potential future use.

After taking a short rest, the group decides to explore the rest of the mountaintop. They follow the tracks of the mutant creature to a small cave, where they find the body of a red-skinned tiefling woman, one of the missing journeymen. Her horns are missing, which raises the group's suspicion that there might be another creature similar to the one they defeated earlier. 

As they investigate the cave and the body, Specter notices a suspicious lump in the woman's cloak. The group decides to proceed with caution, suspecting a potential trap. The session ends with the group preparing to further investigate the lump and the cave.
The group of adventurers, consisting of Specter, Eldridge, Rock, and Trigger, continue their exploration of the mountain cave. They discover a secret door, which leads them into a natural cave with two paths. One path leads to a room filled with animal body parts hanging from hooks, while the other path splits into two directions, one leading to a storage area and the other to a room with a desk and two tables covered in blood.

Specter investigates the room with the hanging body parts but finds nothing of interest. Meanwhile, Eldridge casts Detect Magic to sense any magical presence within 30 feet, but detects nothing. Rock and Trigger decide to investigate the room with the desk and tables. The room appears to be a makeshift surgery room, filled with farm tools used as surgical instruments and covered in blood. 

On the desk, Trigger finds a collection of drawings and scribblings. The drawings depict the anatomy of the monster they previously fought, while the scribblings are nonsensical phrases and scratched-out drawings. As Trigger flips through the pages, he becomes absorbed in them and falls into a trance-like state. Despite Rock's attempts to snap him out of it, Trigger remains unresponsive. The group decides to tie him up for safety as they continue their exploration.
The group finds themselves in a room filled with supplies and two unopened doors. Trig reads some papers and loses his mind, forgetting everything he read. The group decides to keep the papers for later, suspecting they might be valuable or cursed. They discuss their next move, considering using the Chantry Lantern filled with holy water to potentially ward off undead creatures. However, they decide against it as they haven't encountered any undead yet.

They decide to use Moriarty's familiar, Talk, to scout the rooms behind the doors. Talk is sent through one of the doors and finds a half-orc man in a cage, five tanks with twitching things inside, and a humanoid woman wearing a rebreather mask. The woman notices Talk and starts questioning if it's a dream or reality.

The group debates their next move, considering freeing the half-orc man, trying to convince the woman they are the "big bad guy" she's been chasing, or using entangle to restrain her. They decide to lure the woman out of the room. As they open the door, Talk flies out, and the woman follows it. She then unlocks the half-orc's cage and starts dragging him towards the tanks. The group decides to storm the room, with Moriarty sneaking in to observe the situation and Talk distracting the woman by landing on the cage.
In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party continues their confrontation with a mad scientist in a laboratory filled with tanks containing grotesque creatures. The scientist is in the process of torturing a half-orc, which the party tries to prevent. 

Specter attempts to persuade the scientist to stop her actions, but she refuses, believing she is doing the work of a dark lord. The party then decides to attack her. Trigger casts Dragon's Breath on the party's owl familiar, Tock, who then uses the spell to attack the scientist. However, the scientist retaliates by throwing a vial at Specter, causing him to fall unconscious from the damage.

Rock tries to attack the scientist with a new ability, but misses. Eldrin then casts Entangle, causing vines to sprout from the ground and restrain the scientist and the half-orc. He also takes on the Starry Form of Chalice. 

In response, the scientist pulls a lever, releasing one of the creatures from its tank. The creature attacks Trigger, who manages to deflect one of the attacks with a shield spell. 

Meanwhile, the invisible Bow moves into position and attacks the scientist, dealing significant damage and revealing his presence. The scientist recognizes Bow as a "dreamer" and throws a vial at him, but misses. 

Trigger then rushes to Specter's aid, healing him and bringing him back to consciousness. He also maintains concentration on the Dragon's Breath spell, allowing Tock to continue using it. The session ends with Trigger fleeing the room.
In this session of the role-playing game, the party continues their battle against a mad scientist and her monstrous creations. The scientist, a human woman, is revealed to be conducting horrific experiments on living beings, creating grotesque and unnatural creatures. 

The party's gnome, Eldren, uses an Entangle spell to restrain the scientist, preventing her from releasing more monsters from the vats in the room. This strategic move proves to be a game-changer, saving the party from a potentially brutal fight. 

Spector, who had been severely injured, retreats to recover, while Rock, despite being poisoned, bravely confronts the scientist. He lands a critical hit, severely wounding her. Eldren then uses a Guiding Bolt spell, dealing significant damage. 

In a desperate move, the scientist throws a poison bomb at Rock, who manages to shield himself. However, the explosion affects a nearby half-orc, one of the scientist's victims, who falls unconscious. Eldren quickly heals him, stabilizing his condition. 

Spector then delivers the final blow to the scientist, killing her. In her dying moments, she reveals that she was driven by a dream of creating a city of ghastly marble walls, towers, and columns. 

After the battle, the party investigates the room, finding more of the scientist's disturbing drawings. They also discover another room containing cages, one of which holds a catatonic human woman and another a seemingly lifeless griffin. The party manages to unlock the woman's cage, but her condition remains unchanged. 

The session ends with the party contemplating their next move, having successfully defeated the mad scientist and her monstrous creations.
The party, consisting of Eldrin, Rock, Specter, and Danny, successfully rescued two journeymen, a half-orc man and a human woman, from a cave in the mountains. They also found two dead bodies and a griffon, which Eldrin managed to heal and release. The rescued journeymen were initially disoriented but regained their senses after a long rest. They explained that they were ambushed and taken captive while returning from a pickup. 

The party then returned to their camp near Channel Gate, where they met with the journeyman who had hired them. She thanked them for their efforts and promised to send a runner with their payment of 550 gold to their castle within a week. Rock suggested keeping the parcel they had retrieved as collateral until they received their payment, but Specter assured him that Kazimir, the person who would pay them, was trustworthy. 

The party then set off for Saratoga, a two-day journey from their current location. On the way, they encountered a broken wagon with a couple of people struggling to fix it. Rock offered to help while the others kept a lookout for potential ambushes.
In this session of the Dungeons and Dragons game, the party continues their journey and encounters a mad scientist named Dr. Zara. She is a gnome who has been experimenting with a dangerous substance called "Dragon's Breath". The party engages in a battle with her, during which Specter is killed by the Dragon's Breath. However, the party manages to defeat Dr. Zara and revive Specter using a potion. 

After the battle, the party finds a scroll case containing toxic texts that drove Dr. Zara mad. They decide to take it to the library in Valiant for further investigation. On their way, they come across a broken wagon with two humans who need help. Elgin and Rock lend a hand and discover that one of the humans is a Minotaur named Asterion, an old friend and mentor of Bo from the library in Riga. 

Bo hands over the toxic texts to Asterion for assessment and they discuss the concept of time and cause and effect. The party then spends the night with Asterion and his companions before continuing their journey the next morning. The session ends with the party discussing their upcoming trip to Treasure Island, Florida for a weekend getaway.
