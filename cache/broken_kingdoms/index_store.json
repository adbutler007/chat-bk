0 All About Valiant The recording is HERE ALL ABOUT VALIANT As a basic background and to help next week when we flesh out your relationships with Valiant Not required to read beforehand but wanted to share in advance to let brainstorming happen None of you know her exact age but 40s or 50s Looks great but also rough worn lots of laugh lines very street smart She was a member of the original mercenary company during the Wyrmrage The Faceless Wyrm contracted the company as he did almost all of the companies in the Broken Kingdoms Valiant could see what was coming and vocally objected to working with him then walked out For a short time this made her persona non grata but she was quickly validated when the Faceless Wyrm and her entire company were destroyed Quick aside on other mercenary companies The following mercs worked with the Wyrm Silver Sons Blood Skulls Penumbra Ironmongers Deepwood Lodge But only Valiant s company was wholly destroyed The rest either had survivors or had not committed all of their forces Mercs not present were the Barrowmen the Grim Accord and Knights of the Falling Star The Barrowmen didn t exist at that time they were only recently founded The Grim Accord did exist but Ossora has them on permanent retainer The Knights of the Falling Star were the only company that outright refused the Wyrm just like Valiant This is a big reason why they are now the preeminent mercs in the Kingdoms they were whole undamaged and polishing a sterling reputation for good judgment There were other mercs present both individuals and those from abroad But they aren t relevant to our story Valiant is inspired by a bard college of swords She plays the lute but instead of singing she s an expert at spoken word storytelling poetry and she uses the lute to play accompanying music or transition from scene to scene So she s more like a skald or Homer or something She s not a regular bard with a character sheet like yours I just took my inspiration from that class She probably won t be going with you on adventurers she s not an extra character to use She s charismatic The kind of person that draws a room s attention but everyone thinks she s only paying attention to them It s not a surprise that once she decided to revive the old company she s been able to attract those willing to fight alongside her She s a very dangerous duelist Not many warriors in the Kingdoms would be willing to face her 1v1 But she s easily overwhelmed by numbers and doesn t have the knack for battlefield tactics That s why she needed a lieutenant In the years between the Wyrmrage and reviving the company she bounced around all over the Kingdoms the continent and beyond She found work as a bouncer a bodyguard a bard whatever paid She ran with the Knights of the Falling Star for a short while given their mutual rejection of the Wyrm but never officially joined She didn t get along with a warrior named Vorislav who would eventually rise to become commander Valiant is genuinely afraid of Vorislav and has gone out of her way to keep your company away from him and the Knights During this middle period she became close friends with Nadia Zhukov and Ryger That pair would go on to found the Barrowmen a new merc company right around the time that Valiant revived your company They are still friendly but there s a certain competitiveness now and they have been slowly growing distant You have not known her to have any romantic partners or to speak of any from her past Valiant is sentimental She has kept various knickknacks from her adventures You ve been around her enough that you re familiar with most of them On the other hand she rarely speaks about the details of her past and hasn t explained why some of these are important to her Two eggs made of smooth white stone think polished quartz or moonstone They glow very softly One with slowly shifting shades of reds oranges browns The second is base green but occasionally swirls dramatically with blues pinks yellows etc A small collection of shrunken heads from Chult Handheld mirrors Each different style but all antique and ornate Though she is not particularly vain A single purple lady s glove with gold stitching Not a child s but too small to be Valiant s Many sets of dice many sets of hand painted playing cards in various states of wear and a chess set She likes to gamble but is very bad at chess Her lute A long necklace strung with the teeth of over 30 different kinds of monsters Sometimes she wears this when meeting with potential clients A long ornate smoking pipe made of brass engraved with script that none of you can read You ve seen her smoke it when she has to make a hard decision She has a small iron chest that she keeps locked She often keeps the glove in the chest and the pipe when she s not using it You ve seen papers inside when she opens it in front of you Where we are starting on the big map Character introductions sort of in order of how they met

this role-playing game session, the characters introduce themselves and their backstories. First, we have Trigger, a half-elf rogue who was once a member of the Valiant Company, a mercenary group that disbanded 600 years ago. He is on a quest to rebuild the company and has a deep connection with the NPC, Rock, a dwarf who was also part of the original Valiant Company. Next is Bohooneel, or Beau, a half-elf bard from the city of Riga. Beau has telepathic abilities and is a former member of the Marble Archive, a group dedicated to preserving knowledge. He is fascinated by history and is working on recreating the history of the Valiant Company. Spectre, a drow rogue, is the son of a criminal organization leader from the Underdark. After being set up by his father, Spectre managed to escape and eventually joined a mercenary company. He has a strong contact in Kazimir Kulik, a powerful merchant in Muscovar, whom Spectre once conned in a game of dice. Lastly, we have Grimgor, also known as Grim, a half-orc who grew up in the village of Stagport. After being transported to a magical realm by the archfey Rhibhini, Grim returned to the Broken Kingdoms with a new sense of purpose. He joined the group in a pub in Novigrad, introducing himself as the \"Fair Bastard Grimgor\". The session ends with the characters bonding and sharing their stories, setting the stage for their future adventures together. The group discusses their characters and their abilities in the game. One character, Grimm, is introduced as a half-orc fighter from the Feywild. He is described as a weapons master with a high emotional intelligence, able to touch someone and immediately understand their emotional state. The group also discusses the balance of their team, with two frontline fighters, an assassin, two healers, and a druid. They express satisfaction with the diversity and balance of their team. The group also discusses the need for a company name, but decide to wait until all members are present. They also discuss their relationships with a character named Valiant.

group also discusses recent events in the financial world, specifically the SEC's fine against Betterment. They express frustration with the SEC's decision, arguing that it was unfair and based on a misunderstanding of Betterment's business model. They also discuss the SEC's recent hearing on cryptocurrency, expressing frustration with the SEC's lack of clarity on whether cryptocurrencies are securities. The group discusses their characters' backstories and how they came to join the company led by Valiant, a charismatic bard. Rock, the lieutenant, was the first to join, having a close relationship with Valiant. Bo, an operations expert, joined after discovering an excerpt from the company's chronicle and seeking out Valiant. Trigger, a wizard, was rescued by Valiant and her team from bandits and decided to stay with the company. Specter, an assassin, was brought into the company after Valiant recognized his unique skills. Grimm, a half-orc, joined last after being invited by Rock. The group also discusses their relationships with Valiant and their roles within the company. They also discuss the company's history and Valiant's mission to restore it to its former glory. The group also discusses the potential for social interactions in the game, given their characters' high charisma and persuasion skills. The group also discusses the NPC Daria Ashbrow, a fence who runs the general store and has connections with the Thieves' Guild.

Specter, the drow rogue, is revealed to be seeking strength in numbers due to his dangerous past.

had been tasked with finding a lost courier in the mountains, but ended up being attacked by a family of yetis. The courier and the rest of their squad were killed, leaving only Bo and Specter to retreat. The group also discusses the potential for conflict with Grimm, the newest member of the group, and the possibility of diverging interests within the group. They agree to think about what their individual lines might be, where their personal interests might override their loyalty to the group. Finally, they discuss potential names for their group, but do not settle on one. They also review the NPCs (non-player characters) created for the game, including a bugbear named Hawthorne and a drow named Asterion. In this session, the players continue to develop their characters and the world for their upcoming role-playing game. They discuss the backstory of Valiant, a character who is a leader of a mercenary company. They also discuss the potential names for their mercenary company, considering options like \"Valiant Redemption\" and \"Unexpected Returns\". However, they decide to wait for another player, Mike, to join before finalizing the name. They also discuss the structure of the game, which will involve choosing individual jobs within the context of a world on the brink of war. The players will have to navigate the politics of the kingdoms and confront the ultimate bad guy, the King in Yellow. The tension between these different levels will shape the bigger picture of the game. The players also explore the Notion AI tool, discussing how to use it to organize their game information, such as NPCs, locations, and organizations.

party continued their journey south down the Stone Road towards the site of their next job, the bank job in Saratov. On the way, they encountered a two-headed giant named Boris, who was sleeping with a treasure chest. The party managed to sneak past him with the help of Trigger's magical tinkering, which created a white noise to mask their movements. They continued their journey, passing other travelers and warning them about Boris. As they neared their destination, Elgin expressed concern that they hadn't seen any signs from their scout, Hawthorne. Trigger sent his bird, Tak, to scout the area, but the bird didn't find anything unusual. The party eventually found the spot where they were supposed to head off the road into the hills, closer to Saratov. The group, Genesis Gambit, continues their journey towards Saratov, navigating through craggy hills and scrubland. Suddenly, Trigger loses touch with his familiar, Toc, indicating danger ahead. They decide to proceed cautiously, despite the potential threat. They encounter a knight named Sir Percival Hawkins, a lieutenant of the Silver Suns. He reveals that they are also there for the bank job, turning the mission into a competition. The group is led to a hidden campsite where they meet Titus Prolix, Chief of Staff to the Chairwoman of the Bank of Riga. He informs them that the competition will commence in the morning and advises them to rest. They also reunite with Hawthorne and the rest of their scout company, who were being held captive. The group sets up camp and decides to visit the Barrowmen, a friendly group also participating in the competition. They learn that the Barrowmen arrived a day earlier and have been dealing with the arrogant Silver Suns. During the conversation, they discover that a giant has been spotted in Raventree, a town associated with the Barrowmen. The news upsets Nadia, the commander of the Barrowmen, as they were unaware of the threat in their town. The group expresses regret for not dealing with the giant when they had the chance.

group discusses the situation with a frost giant causing a disturbance at a cemetery, which they had previously decided to avoid due to time constraints. They agree to help the Barrowmen deal with the giant after their current mission. Sir Percival from the Silver Suns approaches the group, asking if they have any information about their current location, Saratov, from their chronicle. The group decides not to share any information with him, considering the chronicle as an asset to be protected. They also contemplate providing misinformation to misdirect the Silver Suns. Trigger, one of the group members, approaches Titus to inquire about any spell scrolls he might have for trade. However, Titus reveals that he doesn't possess any such items as his talents lie outside of the arcane. Later, the group consults their chronicle and learns more about Saratov. The city was known for its many temples and cults, which led to its downfall during an orc invasion. The city is now a common hiding place for criminals, cultists, and wandering monsters. The group also learns about a place called the \"Stone Garden\" within the city, where the original Genesis Gambit group had an unfortunate encounter. The group decides to discuss this information amongst themselves in the morning, keeping it confidential from the other groups. The group, Genesis Gambit, wakes up in the morning to find that the Barrowmen have left. Titus, the leader of the Silver Suns, briefs them on their mission: to retrieve a small cauldron from the ruins of the city. The cauldron is located in a chamber within one of the city's hills, surrounded by a statue garden. However, the exact location is unknown, and it's up to the group to find it. The team that brings back the cauldron will be rewarded with 400 gold, while those who fail but return safely will receive 50 gold. Before they set off, Titus presents them with non-disclosure agreements to sign, ensuring the mission's confidentiality. Percival, the leader of the Silver Suns, signs immediately, followed by Beau. Rock, the lieutenant of Genesis Gambit, signs reluctantly after some teasing from his team. The group then discusses their strategy.

decide to send Toc up once they're a safe distance from the Silver Suns. As they journey into the city, Eldrin guides them efficiently, avoiding potential hazards. However, they come across a disturbing sight: a fresh puddle of blood under an ancient skeleton. The source of the blood is unknown, adding an element of danger and mystery to their mission. In this role-playing game session, the group of adventurers, consisting of Eldren, Rock, Grim, Trigger, and Bo, are navigating through a desolate city. They encounter a puddle of blood under a mummified corpse, which turns out to be a dangerous entity that attacks Grim. After a brief skirmish, they manage to repel it and decide to avoid such hazards in the future. Guided by Eldren's survival skills and Trigger's directions, the group moves towards a hill covered in lush vegetation. They hear chittering and laughter, which turns out to be small plant-like creatures, referred to as \"thorn kids\". The creatures trap the group by causing thorns to burst from the ground, blocking their exit. A battle ensues, with Rock leading the charge, followed by Grim. The thorn kids spit wooden darts at the group, injuring Rock. Trigger uses a firebolt spell on one of the creatures, causing significant damage, while Eldren casts an entangle spell, restraining one of the creatures. Bo attempts to shoot one of the creatures but misses, though he successfully uses a telekinetic shove to push one off a cliff. The session ends with Rock and Grim engaging one of the creatures in close combat. The group's strategy appears to be focusing on using their abilities to control the battlefield and whittle down their enemies. In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party continued their battle against the wooden creatures. Rock, with the help of War Cry, dealt significant damage to creature B, while Grim successfully eliminated creature C that was grappling his leg. Creature D managed to escape, while creature A was severely damaged by Bo's psychic attacks. During the battle, Eldrin noticed a ghostly hobgoblin who warned them of a larger threat approaching.

tree monster charged at Trigger and Bo, dealing significant damage and knocking Trigger prone. The session ended on a cliffhanger, with the party preparing to face off against this new, formidable enemy. In this session of the role-playing game, the group of adventurers continue their journey through a ruined city. They encounter a ghost of a hobgoblin who seems to be observing their actions. Suddenly, they are attacked by a monstrous tree troll. The group engages in a fierce battle with the creature, using a variety of spells and attacks. Trigger, the gnome wizard, uses Chromatic Orb to deal fire damage, while Eldren, the druid, casts Faerie Fire to make the monster easier to hit. Bo, the rogue, uses Healing Word to restore some of Trigger's health, and Grim, the warforged, casts Bane to weaken the monster's attacks. Rock, the fighter, also lands a critical hit on the monster. Despite the monster's attempts to defend itself by forming a bramble shield, Eldren manages to finish it off with a Guiding Bolt spell. After the battle, the group finds a magical wooden shield that was once part of the monster's bramble shield. Eldren decides to keep it and plans to attune to it later. The group considers taking a short rest to recover, but Rock reminds them of the urgency of their mission. They decide to press on, with the ghost of the hobgoblin continuing to observe their actions. The session ends with the group planning their next steps in the ruined city. The transcript does not provide information about a role-playing game session. Instead, it discusses a planned trip to Cuba, the speaker's clean record and previous security clearance, and a future trip to Florida. The speaker mentions that they will be part of a delegation sponsored by the State Department for the Cuba trip and that the vetting process for this trip has already begun.

bypassed a two-headed ogre and arrived at the location where they were greeted by an arrogant human knight, Sir Percival Hawkins, Lieutenant of the Silver Suns, another mercenary organization. They also met Titus Prolix, the chief of staff to the chairwoman of the Bank of Riga, and four of his bodyguards. The team's friendly mercenary company, the Barrel Men, left during the night to deal with a giant in their hometown. The team began the bank job the next morning, entering the city to retrieve a small iron cauldron from an underground chamber in one of the hills of the city. They encountered a strange puddle of blood and were attacked by tree-like creatures. During the fight, a ghost of a hobgoblin man appeared and observed the battle. After the fight, the team noticed the ghost and began to interact with him. Danny revealed that he had been talking to ghosts, which surprised the rest of the team. They decided to question the ghost about the whereabouts of the cauldron and any potential dangers they should be aware of. The team also discussed their strategy for exploring the city. They considered the possibility of avoiding fights to conserve resources and complete the job more quickly. They also discussed the potential benefits of splitting up the party to cover more ground. The team decided to continue exploring the city, but to be mindful of potential dangers and to prioritize finding the cauldron over engaging in unnecessary fights. The party, consisting of Rock, Elgin, Grim, and their ghostly hobgoblin guide, continue their journey through the ruined city. The ghost leads them safely, avoiding various hazards such as puddles of blood and unstable buildings. Along the way, the ghost reveals that he doesn't remember his past or his name, and hopes that their journey will help him rediscover his identity. The party eventually arrives at a ruined stone building filled with skeletal remains. The ghost points out a painting on the wall, which is a portrait of him. Elgin straightens the painting, revealing the full image of the ghost in his former life.

discovery suggests that the skeletons might be the remains of the previous company that ventured into the city. The party decides to continue following the ghost, despite the potential risks, as they believe he can lead them to the statue garden they are seeking. The team, consisting of Bo, Trigger, Eldrin, Rock, and Grim, found themselves in a ruined city, where they encountered the ghost of King Toss Rabbits, the last king of Saratov. The ghost was unaware of his past and the team helped him remember by showing him his portrait. They also discovered the skeletons of the original Genesis Gambit team, who had been killed by physical violence. Among the remains, they found a clean brass bracelet and some armor, which they took with them. The ghost warned them about his \"lesser cousins\" who were not as friendly as him. Suddenly, ghostly figures, including smudges of shadow and two more substantial figures, appeared, initiating a combat situation. The team decided to retreat down an alleyway, with Bo and Trigger casting mirror image on themselves for protection. Eldrin managed to eliminate one of the substantial figures (A) with a Guiding Bolt, dealing 14 points of radiant damage, and also damaged the other one (B) with a Starry Form Archer attack. However, the surviving figure (B) retaliated by casting a spell that created a pitch-black, freezing darkness around Rock, Grim, and Eldrin. Rock managed to stumble out of the darkness and prepared to attack any minions that approached him. Grim also managed to walk out of the darkness and could see figure B, but not his friends. The session ended with the team preparing to continue the fight against the ghostly figures. The group continues their battle against the shadowy creatures in the haunted house. Beau, Trigger, and Grim are all surrounded by the creatures and are forced to make wisdom saving throws due to the oppressive presence of the creatures. Beau fails his saving throw and becomes frightened, while Trigger and Grim manage to resist the fear. Eldren uses the Chantry Lantern filled with holy water, which causes the shadow creatures to become less substantial and take damage. The lantern's light also gives the creatures disadvantage on their attack rolls.

uses his magic missiles to attack the shadow creatures, managing to kill two of them. Rock attempts to use Shocking Grasp on the creatures but misses. Grim, despite being frightened, manages to kill six of the shadow creatures with a single swing of his glaive. On their turn, the shadow creatures are destroyed by the radiant light from the Chantry Lantern. However, two more substantial looking creatures appear from the dark corners of the room. Eldren's lantern damages them as well, but they manage to blur and become more insubstantial, blending in with their surroundings. The group prepares to continue the fight against these new threats. The group, guided by the ghostly child Toss, continues their journey through the ruined city. They encounter two ghostly figures, which Toss identifies as the spirits of adults who died in the city. The group engages in a battle with these spirits, who have the ability to pass through them, causing a feeling of decay and necrotic damage. The spirits also have the ability to disappear and reappear at will. Despite the spirits' resistance to their attacks, the group manages to defeat them. After the battle, the group decides to continue their journey without taking a short rest, using healing potions to restore their health instead. Toss leads them to a hill, where they find a ruined wall and a bubbling spring. Toss points out an archway leading into the hill, identifying it as the entrance to the statue garden they are seeking. However, he refuses to go any further. As the group enters the statue garden, they hear a voice in their heads demanding payment in the form of their hopes and dreams. When Rock, one of the group members, questions what they should pay with, the voice demands their dreams. Eldrin, the group's bard, attempts to appease the voice by playing a song on his lute, but the voice demands the instrument itself.

character offers up a deeply personal hope, which is violently ripped from them, causing them to suffer two levels of exhaustion and various amounts of psychic damage. Eldren notices a statue that seems to have moved, and upon attacking it, both he and Grimm suffer additional exhaustion and psychic damage. The voice then demands Eldren to give up his hope, which he does, resulting in his glass star charts cracking in half. The group then enters a chamber with a large brazier and an altar with a handprint indentation. They notice hundreds of bat-like creatures hanging from the ceiling, which are attracted to light. When the creatures, which look like hands with wings, come into contact with the light from Eldren's flame and Rock's sword, they absorb the light and cause it to flicker out. Triggerino comes up with a plan to cast light on the handprint indentation on the altar, hoping to attract one of the creatures. Grimm leads Triggerino to the altar due to Triggerino's inability to see in the dark. Triggerino casts the light spell and steps aside, waiting to see if one of the creatures will be drawn to the light. The group successfully retrieves a small cauldron, two scrolls (Alarm and Knock), and a vial of gold liquid from a hidden alcove. They decide to leave the city quickly, guided by the ghost, Toss. Toss requests them to find out about his past life as a king and share the information with him. As they approach a bridge to exit the city, they encounter Sir Percival Hawkins from the Silver Suns mercenary company. He proposes a non-lethal competition for the cauldron, threatening a fight to the death if they refuse. The group considers various strategies, including using magic to intimidate or deceive Hawkins, destroying the bridge, or sneaking around to another crossing. They also contemplate accepting the competition, but worry about the limitations of non-lethal magic. The group is yet to decide on their course of action. In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party, consisting of Eldrin, Grim, Beau, Rock, and Trigger, continue their quest to retrieve a cauldron for Titus Prolix.

soldiers demand the cauldron, but the party refuses, leading to a tense standoff. Eldrin, in an attempt to avoid combat, uses his druidic abilities to create an illusion of the cauldron. The party then tries to deceive the soldiers into believing they are giving up the cauldron and leaving. Trigger uses his minor illusion spell to make a bag of sand look like the cauldron, and Beau helps sell the deception with a convincing speech. The soldiers are fooled, and one of them is sent to retrieve the \"cauldron\". Meanwhile, Eldrin, disguised as a warhorse, makes a break for it, heading towards Titus Prolix with the real cauldron. The rest of the party also starts to flee, but when the soldier realizes the cauldron is an illusion, the chase begins. The party uses various spells and tactics to slow down the soldiers. Trigger casts a web spell to entangle some of them, Beau uses a grease spell to make the ground slippery, and Grim uses gust of wind to propel the party forward and slow down the pursuers. Rock even enlists the help of a ghost, who scares some of the soldiers.

1 The world turns and ages come and pass leaving memories that become legend Legend fades to myth and even myth is long forgotten In this age a wind rises in the Spine of Creation 1 Among the peaks of the mountains where the wind begins sits the Iron Monastery Within its walls of iron and stone the new headmaster looks at his reflection in the mirror and laughs Or screams Who can tell sometimes 1 To the north the wind blows hard and cold until it slams into the forests of Ossora Broken it slinks and whispers until it dies breathless under the towering canopy of ironwood trees There Bink Pilwick sits on a giant mushroom as four figures approach from out of the forest gloom The old gnome speaks Vengeance my friends It is time The four figures smile They have been too quiet for too long Fire Shadow Bone and Blood The Grim Accord will walk the Kingdoms once more 1 To the south the wind races hot across Lake Severin and blusters through the canals of Baku carrying the arguments of traders and scholars But in the palace of the Fisher King there is a room that the wind cannot reach A room with no windows filled with the smoke of incense A half orc woman stands near the center of the room looking down at a massive table that is a perfect replica of the Broken Kingdoms The table is covered in pins figurines and notes written on parchment The half orc woman is beautiful except for a knotted scar that twists the side of her face She looks down at the table and whispers to herself What did you say Asks the fat king sitting in the corner his plate piled with food My dear Dobromir I said things are finally starting to get interesting Valentina reaches down and plants a new pin at the center of the map near the town of Novigrad The parchment tied to the pin reads Genesis Gambit 1 Elsewhere the wind blows a sweet summer breeze through an open window The curtains sway but the single candle in the room doesn t flicker The Walking Man sits alone in that small room listening to the happy sounds of the village in summer The Walking Man Herald in Black Dweller in Darkness He has had many names He has ended many worlds He sits in the small room lit by a single candle He looks at the candle The light goes out Back to Castle Rend Novograd Riga Muscovar have the money Valiant wants us to maintain the good relationships Journeyman job for Muscover Riga bank job Catching up Go down to River Flagon Masha Martin Broadcloack hired us to find the star fragment Martin Broadcloak Trapezohedron created by space dwarves locked in a lead box most of the time The color out of space what he calls it in his notes Creature from a different plane from outside our cosmology Raw matter of the universe Holds power Heat light motion all possible Spymaster Report Baku s spy network valentina is the best she caught our traps we rolled a 9 Nugget reports nothing to report in baku We were stymied A push Muskovar we rolled a 28 Kazamir is Muskovar s spymaster Nugget s Spy Report 1 Roll against Baku We couldn t really find out anything I don t know if we were asking the wrong questions or asking in the wrong places We didn t attract any attention but frankly we didn t learn anything neither Fail in secret 1 Roll against Muscovar Much different story where do I begin Complete Success 2 on next operation versus Muscovar 1 Ok there s the Combine right The group of guilds that rules Muscovar There s actually seven of them seven guilds 1 The most powerful are the Weaver s Guild and the Metalworker s Guild The Weaver s Guild is run by a human woman Vera Bokun Looks like an old maid and quiet as a mouse but rumor is she s got a mean streak The Weaver s control the town of Kirpansk upriver from Muscovar it s where all their mills are 1 The Metalworker s run by a high elf Seona Silverlight Beautiful popular charming ambitious she s the total package She s expansionist Started out just running the jeweler s guild then absorbed the blacksmiths farriers armorers even the cobblers She wants to create a super guild of crafters 1 Then we have our friend Kazimir master of the Spicer s Guild Kazimir is the newest member of the Combine but he s not resting on his ass His brashness and rapid rise rub some people the wrong way but his guild loves him 1 1 Those are the three most powerful guilds There s four more Next is Igor Silverhorn a dwarf master of the Shipwright s Guild Shipping is Muscovar s lifeblood The Shipwrights are apolitical stable predictable They don t bother nobody and nobody bothers them The spice must flow as Kazimir would say 1 After that is Cyril Malachite master of the Stonemason s Guild Malachite is under a lot of stress the Stonemason s are next on Seona s list to gobble up and he s doing his best to resist Two more 1 1 The Brewer s Guild run by another dwarf Rurik Frostbeard He s the guy who just wants everyone to be friends Usually the mediator when the Combine disagrees with itself but also usually taken for granted Not really a mover or shaker the Brewer s don t have enough power or coin to do much 1 And bringing up the rear we have the Mage s Guild Why would the mage s guild be the ass end of power in a big city Apparently it s standing policy for the rest of the guilds no matter what their disagreements to box out the mages to keep them as isolated and toothless as possible They don t fully cut them out because well they re useful 1 That was a lot I apologize but boss we did so good I can t help it We re uh not done yet 1 Now most of these jokers you don t need to worry about unless you want to The real power is between the Weaver s Guild the Metalworker s Guild and the Spicer s Guild They re gonna be the ones driving policy in Muscovar 1 Oh yeah policy What do you think city run by guilds wants More markets More inputs More goods more services more business 1 They all agree with that end Where they might disagree is on the means This is where our information gets squishier so take this all with a few grains Kazimir seems the most conciliatory Seona wants to eat it all up the whole Kingdoms Vera all I know is she ll kill ya if you re on the wrong side but we don t know which side that is 1 Oh yeah one more thing this is important The Spicer s Guild they re a merchant guild right Not a crafters guild like the weavers or metalworkers So they ve got journeyman merchants all over the kingdoms all over the rest of the continent Yeah those journeyman like the ones you helped in the mountains that s Muscovar s spy network That s why the Spicer s Guild is so powerful Kazimir is the spymaster of Muscovar 1 Gotta be careful boss That means when we re running missions in Muscovar we might be dodging or going up against the Journeymen while you re buddy buddy with Kazimir Just something to keep in mind 1 I lied one more thing this is the last I promise The Clock you know the thieves guild They re active in Muscovar obviously The Clock s activities in Muscovar are run by a figure called the Eel You know cause they re slippery Keeps a low profile You don t fine the Eel they find you We choose to do an Opp on Riga invest 200 we find out the results of Bo s 24 roll next downtime Invitation Addressed to Valiant Senior Officers Genesis Gambit It is my honor and privilege to invite you to the ceremony for my Ascension to Archbishop of the Chantry of Dawn The ceremony will start promptly at noon on July 15 with food and drinks on the Chantry grounds to follow Celebratory worship services held at dawn and dusk will be open to all but attendance will be restricted during the ceremony itself Please present this invitation for admittance Formal dress is requested Please note that no weapons armor or spellcasting equipment of any kind will be allowed in the Chantry during the day s events Failure to comply will result in immediate arrest and imprisonment May you walk in the Dawnfather s Light Bishop Zorian Priory of the Lake The HEIST Job Offer Ira and Athlonia What we are about to propose is both highly lucrative and highly dangerous If that doesn t sound like the kind of thing Genesis Gambit is interested in say the word and we ll walk out the door right now No hard feelings Riga Springs Casino Destination resort and casino the jewel of Riga attracts high rollers from across the Kingdoms and beyond We want you to rob it In two months the Casino will be hosting the Dragon s Hoard a card tournament that only comes around every five years We can get you a suite at the resort during the tournament and one of you a seat in the tournament if you want We ll also provide the means for easy storage and removal of the gold a portable hole which you get to keep after the job https www dndbeyond com magic items 4699 portable hole You handle planning and execution But we do have some expectations specifically No violence Weapons aren t allowed in the casino anyways And no evidence it could be traced back to us This has to be clean Did we come to the wrong mercenaries By our estimates the total take should be anywhere between 30 000 and 50 000 gold We split it 50 50 You do the math Other stuff Ira knows or tells you Your suite and the tournament buy in we can make that under pseudonyms or Genesis Gambit Up to you depending on how you want to go in We will be on site during the tournament To observe But don t count on any help unless it is momentarily convenient and riskless for us The Casino is guarded by The Collectors If any of you are unfamiliar with them let me summarize they cannot be bribed at least not with gold and have no fear unless maybe a dragon shows up Even that encounter they might relish And if you re caught stealing or cheating they ll beat you to death with grim efficiency To our benefit however most don t have the eye for deception and they are not involved in actual casino operations We know that the casino s vault is located in the basement With time we may be able to acquire the blueprints

this session, the party returned to Castle Rend after successfully completing their mission in Saratov. They identified the magical items they had found: a Bumper Bangle, a Bramble Shield, a Potion of the Tragic Hero, and a set of Splint Armor. The Bumper Bangle, which can push enemies away, was given to Eldrin. The Bramble Shield, which can grow into a spike growth, was given to Grimm. The Potion of the Tragic Hero, which grants significant combat advantages but leaves the user dying, was also given to Grimm. The Splint Armor, which had the original Gambit symbol, was worn by Grimm as well. The party then experienced a series of cutscenes, which they were not aware of. These scenes introduced new characters and hinted at future conflicts. The scenes included the new headmaster of the Iron Monastery, the Grim Accord preparing to walk the kingdoms again, the Spymaster Valentino placing a pin on Novigrad indicating Genesis Gambit, and the Walking Man, a powerful entity, extinguishing a candle. The session ended with the party updating Valiant, who was training soldiers at Castle Rend, about their successful mission. In this role-playing game session, the characters return to their base after successfully completing two jobs for the Bank of Riga and the city of Muscovar. They discuss their experiences and the potential consequences of their actions, particularly their conflict with the Silver Suns. Valiant, their leader, advises them to trust Percy of the Silver Suns over the Blood Skulls or the Lodge, despite Percy's unpleasant demeanor. They also discuss a mysterious person who can create creatures with vials and glass, and the possibility of seeking information from Constantine, a powerful wizard. However, they decide against it due to the potential danger and Constantine's past conflict with Rock, one of the characters. Upon returning to the local tavern, they find Martin Broadcloak, a cosmologist, telling the story of their recent job involving a star fragment. Martin shares his findings about the fragment, which he calls a trapezohedron due to its precise measurements.

session ends with the characters enjoying their time at the tavern, with some of them indulging in a mysterious tea that Masha, the tavern owner, brews from her backyard herbs. In this session, the group returns to Castle Rend after successfully completing their mission in Muscovar. They are greeted by Valiant, who informs them that the castle is now fully operational and that they have a new recruit, a young woman named Gif, who is a skilled blacksmith and engineer. The group then meets with Martin, a scholar who they had previously helped to retrieve a powerful artifact known as the Trapezohedron.

In Baku, their spies failed to gather any significant information, but in Muscovar, they learned about the seven powerful guilds that run the city. The most influential guilds are the Weavers, Metalworkers, and Spicers.

players also learn about the other guilds, including the Shipwrights, Stonemasons, Brewers, and Mages guilds, each with their own leaders and agendas. The players also discover that the Thieves Guild, known as the Clock, operates in Muscovar under a figure known as the Eel. The players then discuss how to spend their gold. They decide to invest 150 gold for Trigger to learn the spells 'Knock' and 'Alarm'. They also consider investing in their spy networks, the quartermaster, and the weapon master.

group debates whether to attend, considering the potential political implications and the opportunity to network with influential figures. Meanwhile, they also receive a visit from Ira, a red-headed halibald woman they had previously met, and her associate, Athlonia, a tall, statuesque elf woman. Ira proposes a high-risk, high-reward job to the group: to rob the Jewel of Riga, a high-end casino hosting a card tournament called the Dragon's Hoard. The job requires careful planning, execution, and most importantly, no violence. The potential reward is estimated to be between 30,000 and 50,000 gold, to be split 50-50 between the group and Ira's team. The group is intrigued by the proposal, asking questions about the casino's security, the use of magic during the game, and the exact location of the gold. Ira provides some information but admits that they are not sure about the casino's anti-magic measures. The group decides to consider the proposal and discuss it further. They also consider using their spy network in Riga to gather more information. The group is excited about the prospect of planning and executing a heist, and they have two months to prepare for the job. In this session, the group is approached by two individuals, Ira and Athlonia, who propose a heist job at the Riga Casino. The casino is hosting a high-stakes poker tournament, and the group is tasked with stealing the buy-in money, which is estimated to be between 30,000 to 50,000 gold pieces. The group is promised half of the total amount as their cut. Ira and Athlonia provide the group with a portable hole, a magical item that can hold a large amount of items, to transport the stolen gold. The group discusses various strategies for the heist, including posing as security, creating distractions, and using disguises. They also consider the possibility of double-crossing Ira and Athlonia or the bank that owns the casino. The group decides they need to gather more information before finalizing their plan. They consider questions about the casino's ownership, the insurance of the gold, and who would be affected by the theft.

group began by discussing their upcoming plans, including the Archbishop's coronation and the casino heist. They also considered visiting the Minotaur librarian in Riga. They noted the casino's isolated location and discussed potential escape routes and strategies. Hawthorne, a scout, led the group to various spots in the forest where they found the remains of small animals that had been brutally killed. Eldrin attempted to track the creature responsible, but was unable to do so. The group found large paw prints that didn't match any known animal. They also found shards of bone that appeared to have been worked on, suggesting the presence of an intelligent creature. Eldrin attempted to use his nature skills to identify the creature, but was unsuccessful. The group considered the possibility that the creature could be a pet or a druid. They also discussed setting up alarms or traps to protect themselves. The group decided to return to the castle and inform the others about the potential threat. They also planned to return to the forest with different spells to further investigate the mysterious creature. The Genesis Gambit group prepares to attend the Archbishop's ceremony and the casino job. Valiant uses the company's operating costs to buy each member fancy clothes for the events. Trigger decides to stay at Castle Rend and work on his projects, while the rest of the group plans to attend the ceremony. Valiant has a private conversation with Grimm, expressing her appreciation for his presence in the company and encouraging him to fully commit to the group. She also mentions a small iron chest that contains items that could help the group in case she is unable to do so. The group discusses the security of Castle Rend while they are away, deciding to station a full-time guard and close the gates. They feel comfortable leaving Trigger and Martin in charge, with nearly 50 other people present. The group travels to the Chantry of Dawn via riverboats, arriving in the farming community where the Chantry is located. They notice a significant guard presence at the Chantry, including guards from the Chantry and guards from Baku.

are met by Tybalt Ashbrow, who informs them that the King of Baku and a VIP from Osora will be attending the event. Rock, having a history with the King, decides to distance himself from the event and waits outside. Tybalt introduces the party to two older figures, a purple tiefling named Purpose and a black dragonborn named Erasmus. Purpose is the Chancellor of the Academy in Baku, while Erasmus is a tavern owner in Lake Rest. They were friends of the former Archbishop and express their gratitude to the party for retrieving his body. Erasmus also mentions a fourth member of their adventuring party, Belagar Redsmith, the forge father of Crag Hall, who will be attending the ceremony. The party then takes their seats, with Eldrin keeping an eye out for any suspicious behavior. However, he only notices the general nervousness of the attendees due to the importance of the event. Purpose invites the party to visit the Academy in Baku, offering them access to its library as a token of gratitude for saving their friend. The group attends the coronation of Archbishop Zorian at the Chantry. The ceremony is attended by various notable figures including the Fisher King of Baku, a young human woman, a wood elf woman named Aoife O'Regan, and a mountain dwarf named Belagar Redsmith. The ceremony is a lengthy and traditional affair, with prayers, hymns, and rituals. Before the reception, Belagar Redsmith makes a speech honoring the previous Archbishop, Stenz Novak, and expressing hope that Zorian will follow in his footsteps. The group finds this speech intriguing and plans to approach Redsmith later for more information. During the reception, Eldrin speaks with Aoife O'Regan, sharing his recent encounter with a strange creature in the forest. Aoife suggests that the creature could have been a manticore or a chimera. They also discuss the current state of their homeland, Osora, and Aoife reveals that she was in Baku for negotiations with the king. Meanwhile, Rock observes the event from a distance, noting the presence of guards and the arrival and departure of the guests.

first approach King Dobermire, who is known for his greed and gluttony. They discuss the bone fragments they found, but the King is unable to provide any help. They also meet Aoife, a formidable elder from the forest, who is respected and feared by many. Next, they introduce themselves to Bellagar Redsmith, the Forge Father of Crag Hall, who is surprised to meet them.

before they could execute their plan, three more arrows were shot from the trees, killing two guards and a party-goer. The guests began to flee indoors for safety. Specter decided to hold his action due to the lack of cover in the open area. Grim followed the crowd, moving towards the king and the archbishop for protection. Bo continued his approach towards the direction of the arrows, but failed to spot the attacker due to a low perception roll. Eldrin, still in his warhorse form, managed to reach Rock and was ready to charge back towards the attacker. The session ended with the party preparing to counter-attack. During this session of the role-playing game, the characters were attending a party when they were suddenly attacked by unseen assailants. The attackers used arrows to kill two guards and a party-goer, but did not target the player characters. The characters tried to locate the source of the arrows, which seemed to be coming from the trees behind a pond. Eldren transformed into a warhorse and Rock rode on his back, charging towards the direction of the arrows. As they crossed a stream, they were briefly entangled by magical vines but managed to break free and continue their charge. Meanwhile, Beau spotted a giant hyena hiding in the trees. The hyena seemed to respond to a whistle from the direction of the arrows and then ran off into the forest, disappearing abruptly as if by magic. Beau attempted to chase the hyena but lost sight of it. Back at the party, Grim tried to calm the panicked guests and asked the king and Belagar if they had any idea what was happening. The king seemed nonchalant about the attack, suggesting that it was probably an assassination attempt on him. Despite their efforts, the characters were unable to locate the attackers or the hyena. The session ended with them regrouping and trying to figure out their next move. In this session, the characters are at a party when an attack occurs. An archer, who never misses, shoots and kills a young woman named Princess Popplestone, the niece of a noble merchant from Suncrest and the date of the king. The characters, along with other guards, try to track down the archer but are unsuccessful.

group reconvened at the Chantry after an assassination attempt during the Archbishop's coronation. The assassin targeted a young noblewoman, Princess Popplestone, who was attending the event with the King of Baku. The assassin, who was an expert archer, also killed several guards from Baku before fleeing with a giant hyena. The group discovered that the tracks of the hyena matched those found near their castle, suggesting a connection. The group met several individuals at the event, including Erasmus, a Black Dragonborn, Chancellor Purpose of the Zoria Academy, Belagar Redsmith, a master smith, and Jester Greenhill, a halfling planning to attend a tournament. They also met Aoife Uregan, a diplomat from the forest city of Osara. Upon investigating the arrows used in the assassination, Eldrin found that the arrowheads were made of bone and the shafts were made of ironwood from Osara. The group speculated that the King of Baku might have orchestrated the assassination himself. Valiant attempted to read the King's mind but found him repeating the same thought over and over, suggesting he was hiding something. The group decided to question the King about the possible motives behind the assassination. In this role-playing game session, the characters are investigating the assassination of a character named Princess, who is a low to mid-level noble. The characters are trying to figure out who is behind the assassination and why it happened. Specter, one of the characters, notices a server who seems unusually calm given the circumstances. He decides to approach the server, using a distraction created by Bo to get close without being noticed. Specter then threatens the server with a dagger, demanding to know if he was involved in the assassination. The server reveals that he is part of a group called Genesis Gambit, and that they were hoping to catch a \"bigger prize\" by causing chaos with the assassination. The server's calm demeanor and cryptic words suggest that there is a larger plot at play. Meanwhile, other characters discuss the arrows used in the assassination, which were made from bone and extremely well-crafted. They speculate that the arrows could have been made by a skilled assassin, possibly from a distant part of the continent.

they dismiss this idea as too far-fetched. The session ends with the characters still trying to piece together the clues and understand the motives behind the assassination. In this role-playing game session, the characters, including Bo and Specter, engage in a tense encounter with a spy from the kingdom's spy network. The spy was disguised as a caterer at an event the characters were attending. After a violent confrontation, the characters manage to subdue the spy and attempt to interrogate him. Bo, who has telepathic abilities, tries to penetrate the spy's mind but is blocked by a mental wall. Specter then communicates with the spy using Thieves' Cant, a secret language known among thieves. The spy reveals that the king had received information about a potential threat to someone important to him. The event was a trap to confirm the validity of the threat. The spy also hints that they were aware of the characters' reputation and capabilities. After the interrogation, the characters untie the spy and let him go, with Specter expressing a belief that they will meet again. The spy blends back into the crowd seamlessly, demonstrating his professional skills. The characters are left with the knowledge that the threat to the kingdom is real and that the spy network is highly skilled and prepared. Meanwhile, another character plans to transform into the spy in a future heist, taking note of his nondescript appearance. The characters also discuss the spy's ability to block telepathic intrusion, indicating that the spy network is prepared for such tactics. The session ends with the characters reflecting on the encounter, acknowledging the skill of the spy network, and planning their next moves. In this session, the characters continue to investigate the assassination attempt at the Archbishop's ceremony. They deduce that the assassins were targeting someone important to the king, and mistakenly thought Princess Popplestone was this person. The group realizes that the assassins were likely aiming for Valentina, the king's spymaster, and that the attack was a test to confirm their information source. The group also discusses their upcoming casino job.

Martin, the scientist working on the fragments of the fallen star, is making progress. He believes he is close to locating one or two more fragments and expresses a desire to retrieve them. The group agrees to escort him when the time comes. The characters also plan to visit Riga before the casino job to gather more information and complete side quests. They have a week before they need to leave, giving them time to prepare and strategize. In this game session, the characters are planning a heist on a casino in the city of Riga. They are briefed about the key players in the city, including the Queen, the head of the archive, and the head of the clock. The characters are also informed about the bank's interests and the potential repercussions of their failed spy mission at the casino. Daria, a supplier, visits the characters at their castle with a variety of magical items sourced from the guild, all designed to aid in the heist. These items include a scroll of wrist pocket, lock links (cufflinks that can produce thieves' tools and unlock non-magical locks), key coins (coins that can unlock any lock, including magical ones, for a short period), a potion of aqueous form (which can turn the drinker into water for 10 minutes), and barking stones (stones that emit a dog barking sound when thrown, useful for distractions). The characters are informed that they will owe Daria three and a half percent of their take from the heist, plus the cost of the items. The session ends with the characters contemplating their plan for the heist, with the understanding that it could potentially be accomplished without any dice rolls, challenging the players rather than their character sheets. In this session, the group continues their planning for the heist at Riga Springs Casino. They meet with Daria, a member of the Clock, who provides them with various magical items to aid in their mission. These include key coins, lock links, barking stones, a wand of limited magic detection, and a foliage seed. The group decides to take all the items, despite the cost, as they believe it will be beneficial for their mission. Daria also offers them a short-term loan of 250 gold pieces, with a 20% interest rate per month.

this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party approaches a fortified goblin outpost. Frankie Fighter and Gift act as a distraction, drawing the attention of two goblin guards on a bridge. Nugget, a rogue, stealthily climbs a wall and takes out a goblin on a tower with a well-aimed shot from his sharp bow. Viserion attempts to attack the goblins on the bridge but misses. The goblins retaliate, slashing at Frankie and Gift before retreating, calling for their comrade Fritz. Gift casts Sanctuary on herself and taunts the goblins in their own language, trying to draw them back. Mikey the Turtle climbs the wall to get a better vantage point, while Jake, a druid, transforms into his starry form and attacks one of the goblins with a radiant arrow, but misses with a Guiding Bolt spell. An unseen goblin, presumably Fritz, shoots an arrow from a tower, hitting Jake. Frankie chases after the retreating goblins, slashing one with his scimitar. Nugget moves under the bridge and takes out another goblin. Viserion moves to get a better line of sight on the remaining goblin. The session ends with the party preparing for their next moves. The group of adventurers, consisting of Frankie, Mikey the Turtle, Jacob, Gift, and Bysserian, continue their exploration of a goblin-infested fortress. Frankie and Mikey manage to scale the fortress walls, with Frankie reaching the top of a tower and Mikey entering a second-floor room. Inside, Mikey discovers a giant, blue, frosty man, who appears to be unconscious and reeking of alcohol, strapped to a table. Meanwhile, the rest of the group, Gift, Jacob, and Bysserian, decide to take a more cautious approach and walk around the fortress. They enter the courtyard, noticing a large, fresh hole in the ground. As they approach a set of stairs leading to the second level, a giant spider with a platform on its back emerges from the hole.

session ends with the group bracing for a fight against the giant spider. In this Dungeons and Dragons game session, the characters are engaged in a battle with a giant spider. The spider initially charges at the group, managing to hit Viserion and Nugget, causing them damage. The group retaliates with a series of attacks. Nugget, after being hit, disengages and moves back to shoot at the spider, but misses. Gift, from a safe distance, successfully hits the spider with a firebolt. Jacob Vibranium also manages to hit the spider with a guiding bolt and a starry form archer attack. Mikey the Ninja Turtle, after a failed acrobatic stunt that resulted in him falling from a roof, recovers and launches a series of attacks on the spider using his nunchucks and claws, dealing significant damage. Frankie Fighter Deadpool, despite a failed initial attack, manages to climb onto the spider's back and lands a hit.

They encounter a giant war spider, which they manage to defeat after a fierce battle, dealing a total of 73 points of damage in two rounds. After the battle, they discover a frost giant named Ragnar, son of Stormald, who is tied to a table. Ragnar claims to have partied with the goblins and asks the adventurers to release him, promising to help them kill the goblins. The team decides to leave him tied up until they've cleared out the remaining goblins.

manages to revive him using a healing spell, but Frankie is soon knocked unconscious again by another goblin attack. Meanwhile, Ninja Turtle performs an impressive acrobatic move, sliding down a table to attack a goblin. Despite the team's efforts, they are outnumbered, and the goblin queen uses her legendary action to call for reinforcements. The session ends with the adventurers in a precarious situation, facing a growing number of goblins. In this session of the role-playing game, the players continue their battle against Queen Parsnip and her minions. The Queen manages to land a hit on Ninja Turtle (Mikey), but misses her other two attacks. Viserion, another player, retaliates with a Firebolt against the Queen, dealing minor damage. The Goblin Sniper attempts to attack Mikey but misses, while Frankie, who is down, makes successful death saving throws. Nugget, who is also close to being down, manages to kill a minion before disengaging and moving away from the fight. Gift, another player, initially plans to cast heroism on Frankie to give him temporary hit points, but realizes that it won't restore him to consciousness. Instead, Gift uses an action to feed Frankie a healing potion, restoring some of his hit points. Jacob Viburnum and Mikey both attack the enemies but deal minimal damage. At the end of the round, Queen Parsnip retreats, leaving her minions to continue the fight. The session ends with the players planning their next moves, with the expectation that they will easily dispatch the remaining lackeys in the next session. The transcript discusses the scheduling of future game sessions. The speaker is unable to attend the game on the 12th due to travel and packing. They propose to play the next game on the 19th and then on October 5th. The October 5th game will be set in Riga and will involve the primary characters.

their rest, the party and Ragnar moved through the fortress, with Ragnar breaking through doors due to his size. They encountered three goblins, which they quickly dispatched with the help of the Frost Giant. However, as they moved further into the fortress, another door opened ominously, prompting the party to prepare for another potential encounter. The party then rolled for initiative, preparing for the upcoming battle. The Druid, who was low on spell slots, decided to use a Thorn Whip cantrip against one of the goblins. The party also noticed a muscular goblin carrying a large axe and a goblin queen in the back, indicating a challenging fight ahead. In this session of the role-playing game, the team continues their battle against the goblin queen and her minions. The queen summons more minions to her aid, but the team manages to hold their ground. Jacob Viburnum uses his Thorn Whip and Starry Form Archer abilities to attack the Spine Cleaver, a muscular goblin wielding a greataxe. Despite the damage, the Spine Cleaver remains standing. Meanwhile, the queen attacks Mikey, a turtle-like character, with her short sword, managing to hit him once. Mikey had previously attacked the queen with his nunchuck and claws, landing a successful hit with his claws. Gift, another team member, attempts to use Toll the Dead on the queen, but she successfully resists the spell. Gift also heals Viburnum, restoring some of his hit points. Frankie, also known as Deadpool, engages in combat with the Spine Cleaver, using his scimitar and healing himself with Second Wind. He also uses an Action Surge to attack again. The team's ally, a frost giant, unleashes a powerful attack that kills several minions and severely injures the remaining enemies. However, the exertion causes him to vomit and pass out. Finally, Viserion, a gold dragonborn sorcerer, enters the fray. He uses his fire breath on the Spine Cleaver, opening his mouth impossibly wide to unleash the attack.

Viburnum starts the round by attacking the Queen with his archer, dealing significant damage. The Queen retaliates by attacking Mikey and Gift, but Gift uses Silvery Barbs to make her miss. The Queen then retreats, calling more goblins from a nearby room to join the fight. Adam attempts to attack the Queen with a Chromatic Orb but misses. The Frost Giant, still recovering from his previous attack, does nothing. The minions attack Gift and Deadpool but both miss. Deadpool then eliminates two minions with his scimitars. Gift uses a psychic attack on a goblin wizard, dealing minor damage, and casts Sanctuary on herself before moving into the fray. Mikey, despite being in a precarious situation, manages to land a hit on one of the goblins. The session ends with the Curse Spitter casting a spell on Mikey, who manages to resist its effects. The party is still in the midst of battle, with the Goblin Queen and her minions posing a significant threat. The party continued their battle against the goblins in the castle. After a series of attacks, the goblin queen called for a parley, offering to leave the castle and give the party all the gold and items they had accumulated in exchange for their lives. The party agreed, and the queen led them to a room filled with gold, spell scrolls, a potion, and a monocle. Meanwhile, Mikey and Viserion explored another room where they found a locked door. A goblin named Blister was trapped inside, claiming he was locked up because he disagreed with the goblins' actions. Mikey convinced the queen to give him the key to free Blister, who expressed interest in joining the party. The giant, Ragnar, asked if he could kill one of the goblins before they left. The queen subtly indicated the underboss, whom Ragnar promptly crushed under his foot. The remaining goblins quickly left the castle. Ragnar revealed that he was on a pilgrimage, visiting significant places from the war against the Faceless Worm. He had been shamed twice, once in a town where the heroes, giants, and dragons were buried, and again when he was captured by the goblins. Despite his shame, he decided to continue his pilgrimage.

party invited Ragnar to join them, but he declined, choosing to continue his journey alone. In this session, the group of adventurers, consisting of Frankie Fighter, Viscerion, Gift, and Blister, successfully cleared out the goblin-infested tower. They found a treasure chest containing 233 gold pieces, a potion of climbing, a spell scroll of cure wounds, a spell scroll of lesser restoration, and a recipe for a potent poison. They also encountered a frost giant named Ragnar, who was on a pilgrimage to visit the Brass Door, a site of a great battle. Ragnar shared stories about his father, Jarl Storvald, who led the Frost Giants in the great fight. The group invited Ragnar to join their company, Genesis Gambit, but he declined, stating he would consider it after his pilgrimage. The group then decided to test Blister's skills. Frankie Fighter challenged Blister to sneak a firecracker into Viscerion's pocket, which he successfully did, causing a small explosion. This revealed Blister's potential as a recruit for their company. The group discussed allocating Blister to one of the officer titles, such as quartermaster, scout, or spymaster, but decided to defer the decision. They also considered using the poison recipe, but decided to wait due to its high cost. The session ended with the group deciding to wait for their senior officers to return from the casino job before making any major decisions. They also leveled up to level three. The players discussed their next steps in the game. They decided to follow up on the research about the hobgoblin ghost, the old king they had encountered. They planned to visit the library to learn more about his history and the kind of king he was. They also decided to visit Luca, the head of the clock in Riga, who runs a coffee house and jazz bar. They considered this visit as an opportunity to introduce themselves or potentially purchase something from Luca that Daria didn't have. They also planned to visit a zoo in Riga, a big city, to see the various creatures that exist in the game world.

fields Bo does research on Poker Who was the Hobgoblin King Tos Ravitz young nephew of Saretovs ruling class Young when the orcs first invaded Was a cad as he grew up no responsibilities Never amounted to anything because nothing was expected 1 by 1 the heirs died until Tos Tos was a nickname but it became his known name One of the reasons the Temples of Saretov were defeated was because they were fractious couldn t work together Doomed his rule Competiton is why the orcs won Tos stopped paying tithes to the temples Poured that money into the cities defenses It was obviously doomed from the beginning but he did it anyways Orcs came to the city for the last time all the clerics etc argued till it was too late In his last moments when the end was obvious his rage against the temples overcame him he opened the gates to the orcs King Toss Ravitz A nephew of Saratov s ruling family he was young when the orcs first invaded He was something of a cad drinking and gambling no responsibilities Even when the war heated up and the attacks came more regularly he never amounted to anything because nothing was ever expected of him But one by one the royal family started dying

few of his family members killed if they made the mistake of not appeasing one temple or another But he did what he could under his power given the circumstances He evacuated citizens willing and able to travel to Riga or Kazan both cities that were better defended He stopped giving tithes to the temples and poured all the city s remaining resources into rebuilding and retraining the city guard But in the end it didn t matter and consensus from historians since then is that it would have been obvious to Toss that everything he did was in vane The orcs came to Saratov for the final time sieging

group of level two fighters, who have just freed Ragnar, the frost giant teenager, are now headed to Riga. They have a few objectives in Riga: to check up on the toxic text and do some research on the ghostly king at the library, to visit Luca's place, the Thieves Guild hangout, and for Eldren to learn a few more animals at the zoo. They are also planning to participate in a casino tournament, for which their entry fee has already been paid by Ira. However, they have sent a spy to the casino for reconnaissance, who has been caught and not returned. The group is now trying to come up with a plausible excuse for their spy's presence at the casino. They consider saying that they sent the spy to test the casino's security before they brought their money for the tournament. They also discuss the possibility of getting the blueprints of the casino, which Ira can provide for an extra 10% cut. They decide to defer this decision until they get to the casino and assess the situation. In preparation for the tournament, they consider training Bo, who is supposed to play in the tournament, in card playing to give him an advantage. However, the DM decides against this, stating that Bo and the DM will play straight up Texas Hold'em head to head during the tournament. The group also discusses the possibility of Trigger, who has a week in Riga, making something useful for the heist, given the time and budget constraints. The group decides to visit Riga, a city that is reminiscent of French North Africa, known for its lively atmosphere, rich culture, and diverse population. Bo feels at home in Riga, having worked there for a long time at the library. The group decides to visit Luca's place first, a coffee house/jazz bar run by Luca, one of the five leaders of the Clock, a thieves guild. Upon arrival, they are immediately taken by the vibrant ambiance of the place. The jazz band, consisting of a human, a goblin, and a bugbear, captivates the crowd. The group is served coffee, pastries, and hookah without even having to order. Eldrin is particularly fascinated by a Velociraptor accompanying a Goliath woman named Moloch, the head of the collectors, a group that protects the bank's interests.

group then decides to pay their respects to Luca. They order a round of whiskies and request the waiter to inform Luca of their presence. The waiter returns with a bottle of whiskey, coffee liqueur, and seven perfectly rolled joints, which they enjoy. The group anticipates meeting Luca, hoping to establish a good relationship with him. The characters visit a jazz club owned by a bugbear named Hawthorne, who is also a friend of their contact, Dahlia. They enjoy the music and the atmosphere, and eventually get a chance to speak with Hawthorne after his set. They reveal that they are friends of Dahlia and are in town for a tournament. Hawthorne offers them hospitality and tells them they can ask for his help if they need anything. The characters discuss their plans for the upcoming heist at the casino. They consider asking Hawthorne for information about the tournament and the casino, but decide against it to avoid arousing suspicion. They also discuss potential strategies for the heist, such as using magic to disguise themselves or to feign death. However, they decide to hold off on finalizing their plan until they have more information about the casino and the tournament. Hawthorne eventually leads them to a private room in the club, where he reveals that he also has an interest in the tournament. The characters ask if they can help him with his plans, but the details of this conversation are not revealed in the transcript. The group meets with Luca, a contact from the Thieves' Guild, at a bar. Luca asks them to find out what Lorna Goldgut, the manager of the casino, collects. He suggests they could get her assistant drunk to extract the information. The group agrees to the task, with the understanding that they will owe Luca a small favor in return. The group then discusses their travel plans to Tampa, where they will be staying in an Airbnb. They plan to cook steaks on a grill and possibly visit a local butcher for supplies. Finally, the group visits the Marble Archive, a large library in Riga. Beau is recognized by a librarian who leads them to Asterian, a Minotaur and Beau's old friend.

group's conversation with Asterian is not detailed in the transcript. In this role-playing game session, the characters visit a library to gather information about various topics. The towering Minotaur figure, who is the archivist of the library, warmly welcomes them. The characters, particularly Trigger and Bo, express their interest in spending time in the library to research various topics. The archivist provides them with information about the \"toxic text\" they had previously given him. He explains that the text is divided into three components: the words, the anatomical drawings, and a strange, incomplete symbol that was the source of the text's toxicity. He reveals that four librarians experienced temporary madness after coming into contact with the symbol. The archivist then introduces Gerda, a hill dwarf woman, who provides information about Karina, a former librarian who drew the anatomical drawings in the toxic text. Karina had changed drastically after meeting a man named Walter O'Dimm, and she left the library about a year ago to pursue her \"great work\". The characters express interest in finding Walter and learning more about his connection to Karina and the toxic text. The characters also research King Toss Rabbits, a hobgoblin ghost friend. They discover that Toss was the last surviving member of Saratov's ruling class, who tried to save his city from Orcs but ultimately failed. There's a story that Toss, in his rage at the city's temples for their inaction, opened the city gates to the Orcs himself. The session ends with Trigger offering a gift to Astarion - a sheaf of pages containing complex mathematical work done by a cosmologist. The characters plan to continue their research and investigations in the library. In this session, the group continues their investigation into the mysterious Martin Broadcloak. They visit the library to speak with Asterion, the head librarian, and share their findings. Trigger presents Asterion with some of Broadcloak's research papers, which the librarian finds fascinating and agrees to add to the library's collection. He also notes that Broadcloak's research into the fabric of the universe is potentially dangerous and powerful.

this session of the role-playing game, the characters wake up in Castle Rend and prepare for their journey to the Chantry of Dawn. Trigg, the gnome, gives Eldrin a morning blessing, the Gift of Alacrity, which will enhance his initiative rolls for the next eight hours. The group then sets off, planning to travel along the river to Lake Rest and then decide whether to continue on foot or by boat. On their way, they meet Hawthorne, a scout who shares information about the environment and potential dangers they might encounter. She warns them about bears, owlbears, wolves, and bandits that are common in the Broken Kingdoms. She also mentions the presence of Ankhag, large burrowing monsters, in the farmlands around the Chantry, and Griffins in the nearby mountains known as the Embrace. Hawthorne also shares two recent events. First, a large group of bandits led by a dwarf man robbed a caravan, and the leader was reportedly looking for a woman named Rika. Second, several lone travelers have mysteriously disappeared, with signs pointing to a small group of trained humanoids operating in the forest. The group continues their journey, keeping these warnings in mind. They discuss the need for special glasses for Spectre, who has sunlight sensitivity, and Trigg demands 50 gold pieces for the crafting of such glasses. The session ends with Eldrin being asked to roll a d20, leaving the outcome of this roll unknown.

They cross a recently constructed stone bridge over a stream and encounter a beggar who reveals himself to be a well-armored soldier. The soldier requests more coin, leading to a confrontation. Bo decides to cross the stream to flank the enemy, while Eldrin engages the soldier directly, managing to shatter the soldier's shield with his claws.

Trigger, the gnome wizard, launches a series of magic missiles at the soldier who emerged from the trees, dealing substantial damage but not quite taking him down. A third enemy, a crossbowman, reveals himself and fires a shot at Eldrin, which ricochets and critically hits Trigger, dealing a heavy blow. The crossbowman then ducks behind the bridge's wall for cover. Bo continues his flanking maneuver, preparing to climb the bridge and attack the crossbowman. Eldrin, in response to his injuries, casts a healing spell on himself and attacks the soldier in front of him again, dealing acid damage. In this Dungeons and Dragons game session, the party engaged in a challenging fight against a group of enemies. The party consisted of Janus, Jim, Spectre, Trigger, Bo, and Eldren. The enemies included a trick shot and several other attackers. The fight began with Janus being hit by a bolt, but he managed to sidestep to avoid further attacks. The enemies then targeted Eldren and Trigger, dealing significant damage. Spectre, using his stealth abilities, managed to sneak up on the trick shot and deal a substantial amount of damage before retreating into the bushes. Trigger, despite being heavily wounded, managed to kill one enemy with his magic missile and dealt damage to another. The trick shot attempted to shoot Bo, but missed, and then tried to run away. However, Bo managed to hit him with a crossbow, dealing significant damage and intimidating him. Eldren, after missing an attack, used his ability to turn invisible and moved away from the fight. One of the enemies pursued Trigger, but was killed by Spectre's thrown dagger. Trigger then used his Misty Step ability to teleport away from the remaining enemy and hit him with a firebolt. Finally, Bo delivered the killing blow to the last enemy with a crossbow bolt to the temple. After the fight, the party decided to take a short rest to recover from their injuries.

the rest, they encounter a man named Valgo Ryback, also known as the Kingfisher, who is a well-known figure in the Broken Kingdoms. He is known for his services in rescuing kidnapped victims or catching criminals alive, often refusing payment for his deeds. Valgo is found resting by the road, and upon seeing the party, he greets them and asks if he can join them on their journey. The party agrees, and they continue their journey together, sharing stories and getting to know each other. Valgo reveals that he is heading northwest to Granite Hills, having heard that the town is in trouble. The party, however, is heading to the Chantry of Dawn, having been offered a reward for their services. As they continue their journey, they come across a scene of a recent battle. A wagon is seen off the road, riddled with arrows, and about a dozen commoners are huddled next to it, many of them wounded. There are also several bodies scattered around. The party notices tracks leading away from the scene, indicating that there were at least one or two more wagons that have since disappeared. A red-haired Mountain Dwarf woman steps out from the group by the wagon and waves the party over. In this role-playing game session, the group encounters a Mountain Dwarf woman named Rika Oathkeeper, who is in distress after her caravan was attacked by bandits. Rika, the only surviving guard along with a half-elf named Feather, pleads for the group's help, offering 200 gold in return. The group is initially suspicious of Rika, as they had heard rumors of bandits looking for a woman by the same name. Upon questioning her, they sense that she is not being entirely truthful about the circumstances of the attack. Despite their suspicions, the group decides to help Rika and the remaining merchants and their families. They strategize with Valco, a paladin who also decides to stay and help. Valco suggests using the available resources to set up defensive positions and traps to prepare for a potential second attack from the bandits. The group agrees to this plan, deciding to stay and protect the caravan while also keeping a close eye on Rika.

this session of the role-playing game, the players discuss their current situation and plan their next moves. They start by reviewing recent events, including the expansion of territories on the map, the rising attacks on travelers, and the movements of various mercenary companies. They also discuss the departure of Martin, a character who left to the north with some of their former soldiers. The players then discuss their finances, deciding to invest most of their 13,000 gold in various areas. They consider buying magic weapons, but realize that these are rare and difficult to acquire. They also discuss allocating their two new recruits, a hobgoblin ghost and a character named Blister. Trigger, one of the players, has been experimenting with time and has made significant progress. He believes he can create a device that allows him to view the recent past for 500 gold. The group agrees to fund this, seeing potential benefits for espionage and investigation. The group also discusses the locations of two star fragments, one in Muscovar and one near Riga. They consider trying to solve the location of the second fragment. They also discuss the possibility of a war between Baku and Muscovar, and the potential need to intervene if Baku continues to expand. Finally, the group decides to spend 500 gold on spell components for Mike's character, which will allow him to summon beasts and fey creatures. They see this as a worthwhile investment, given the potential benefits in combat. The session ends with the group planning their next moves, including deciding which city to travel to next. The players discussed their strategy for the game, focusing on how to best allocate their resources. They decided to spend their two recruits on the Scout and Spy networks, assigning Toss to the Scout network and Blister to the Spy network in Baku. They also decided to spend 250 gold pieces on a magic weapon for Grim, and discussed the potential benefits and drawbacks of this decision. The players also discussed the potential of upgrading their Quartermaster and Weaponmaster networks.

addition, they decided to trade in a magic item, the Bumper Bangles, to upgrade their Scout network to level five. They also discussed the potential of trading in other magic items, such as the Wind Fan and the Emerald Pen, but ultimately decided against it. Overall, the players made strategic decisions to strengthen their networks and resources, preparing for future challenges in the game. They prioritized upgrading their Scout, Spy, Quartermaster, and Weaponmaster networks, and discussed the potential benefits and drawbacks of their decisions. In this session, the characters return to Castle Rend after their successful casino job. They learn about the events that transpired at the choke, including the appearance of Ragnar the Frost Giant and Blister the Goblin. The group then decides to invest heavily in their company, boosting morale among their ranks. They purchase horses for all senior officers, upgrade weapons and armor, and hire new drill sergeants for training. The group also discusses their financial situation, deciding to spend their remaining 6,344 gold on various upgrades. They decide to spend 1,200 gold on bumping each of the markets up to two, and another 1,200 gold on removing any disadvantages. They also decide to spend 1,000 gold each on Riga and Muscovar, leaving them with 2,144 gold. During this time, Blue, a water genasi, approaches Grim and expresses his desire to return home. Grim promises to look into it. Meanwhile, Trigger investigates the departure of Martin, the scientist, and discovers that the star fragment Martin was experimenting with no longer works. Trigger also conducts a thorough investigation of the castle to ensure there are no hidden devices or spells that could compromise their security. He finds nothing suspicious. As a precautionary measure, he decides to set up an alarm on Valiant's door each night. The group also discusses the possibility of expanding their ranks, anticipating that they could potentially recruit hundreds of new members once they reach a big city. They consider implementing a strict background check process to ensure the loyalty of their new recruits. The group decides to focus their efforts on Muscovar, choosing to ignore the Blood Skulls for now.

decide to roll against Baku, Muscovar, and Riga, with the aim of understanding the state of play in each city and whether they are planning or preparing for aggression. The group's character, who is highly proficient in deception, rolls a 29 against Baku, a 26 against Muscovar, and a 17 against Riga. They learn that Baku has the best spy network in the kingdoms, while Muscovar's is also quite good. The spy network in Riga is not as well-known. Finally, the group decides to journey to Muscovar, with the entire company, Genesis Gambit, accompanying them. The decision is made with the understanding that the company's presence in Muscovar will play a crucial role in the progression of the game. The group, consisting of Rock, Specter, Eldren, Bow, and Trigger, are traveling to Muscovar with their mercenary company, Genesis Gambit. They decide to send a scout team ahead to prepare for their arrival. On their journey, they encounter a foggy graveyard filled with undead creatures. Eldren uses his Entangle spell to restrain the enemies, but the cultist manages to save himself from the spell. Specter then attacks a ghoul, dealing significant damage. The cultist retaliates by casting a necrotic energy spell at Eldren, dealing a substantial amount of damage and leaving him teetering on the brink of collapse. The group prepares to continue the battle. In this session of the role-playing game, the party continues their battle against a group of skeletons, ghouls, and a cultist. Eldran, in dragon form, attempts to cast Guiding Bolt on the cultist but misses twice, despite having advantage due to the effects of Faerie Fire. He then turns invisible and moves to a different location for cover. Specter successfully casts Faerie Fire on the cultist and a skeleton, giving the party advantage on attacks against them. He then moves back to his hiding spot. Rock, after deflecting a death bolt from the cultist with a shield, moves closer to the enemy and casts Witch Bolt, dealing six points of lightning damage.

attempts to attack the cultist but misses, despite having advantage. He then retreats behind a tree for cover. The skeletons attempt to attack Rock and Bo, with one managing to hit Bo for five points of damage. Grim uses his movement and Misty Step to get close to the cultist and attacks twice, dealing a total of 18 points of damage. The ghoul remains entangled and fails to free itself. The party continues to focus their efforts on taking down the cultist, with the skeletons and the ghoul posing less of a threat. In this session of the Dungeons and Dragons game, the party continued their journey to Muskevar. They encountered a graveyard where they were attacked by a cultist and his undead minions. The cultist was an old human man who used necromantic energy to form a scythe from his staff. He also had the ability to resurrect the undead creatures the party killed, and heal himself using their life force. The party focused their attacks on the cultist, realizing that killing the minions was only aiding him. Rock used Thunderwave to push the cultist and a skeleton away, causing the skeleton to fall apart. Bow continued to attack the cultist, dealing significant damage. Trigger finished off the cultist with a fire spell, causing all the undead creatures to collapse to dust. After the battle, the party found a scythe that the cultist had been using.

players struggle to land successful attacks, with many of their rolls resulting in low numbers. Beau attempts to cast Hold Person on the Phantom, but the spell fails as the Phantom is not a humanoid. Eldrin tries to hit the Phantom with a Guiding Bolt, but misses. Rock attempts to cast Witch Bolt, but also misses. Grim, however, manages to land a successful hit on the Phantom, dealing both slashing and necrotic damage. He also uses his Spring Ephemeral ability to turn invisible. Specter casts Fairy Fire on both the Phantom and the Creepy Hobbit, giving the players advantage on their attack rolls against these creatures. However, his attempt to hide behind a bush is unsuccessful, and the Phantom retaliates by throwing a Starblast at him, dealing radiant damage. Trigger attempts to use Mind Spike on the Phantom, but the Phantom is immune to psychic damage. Trigger then retreats behind a stairway to avoid direct line of sight. The Phantom continues to attack the players, blinding both Beau and Rock with its song. The session ends with the players still in the midst of battle, struggling to land successful hits on their opponents. In this session of the role-playing game, the team continues their battle against the Phantom and his minions. The Phantom, who has been singing to the attendees of the theater, causing them to transform into various creatures, is the primary target of the team's attacks. Elgin, the team's cleric, uses a combination of Guiding Bolt and Starry Form Archer to deal significant radiant damage to the Phantom. His attacks are successful, causing the Phantom's robe to become tattered and his mask to chip. Meanwhile, Grimm, the team's warlock, manages to maintain the Bane spell on the Phantom, causing the Phantom to consistently miss his attacks. Grimm also assigns War Cry to Specter, allowing him to deal additional damage on his attacks. Specter, in turn, successfully eliminates a small creeper and deals damage to the Phantom. Trigger, the team's illusionist, uses his illusion to distract a Gibbering Mouther, saving himself from an attack. He also deals significant force damage to the Phantom using his magic missile spell.

the team's fighter, is unfortunately blinded during this session and is unable to contribute to the fight. Towards the end of the session, the Phantom sings to the remaining attendees, instructing them to flee. The attendees begin to leave the theater, causing concern among the team about the Phantom's intentions. The session ends with the team continuing their fight against the Phantom and his minions. In this session of the role-playing game, the characters are in a battle with a phantom in a ballroom. After a series of attacks, the phantom is defeated and collapses, uttering cryptic words about living through the mouths of men. The ballroom then transforms into a sewer, with the characters realizing they were under an illusion. The phantom's body is investigated, but it is wrapped in robes with no discernible features or items. Words appear on the phantom's mask, stating \"I wear no mask.\" The characters then notice graffiti all over the sewer, with ominous messages about the last king, the doom of Sarnath, and the rebirth of Muscovar. They speculate that the phantom was driven mad by the star fragment and the stranger, causing him to rally the people in the theater. The characters decide to leave the sewer, finding a hidden door leading back to the theater. They search the prop room and find a small bottle with a viscous milky white liquid. They also search the theater boxes, finding disturbing scenes of self-inflicted harm and death, and a pile of fine white ash in one box. The characters decide to pocket the mysterious liquid for later identification and plan to alert others about the situation in the theater. The session ends with them planning to find a hotel and rest. The characters continue their investigation in the theater, finding a series of boxes containing various items. They find a body with a cocktail table next to it, on which a napkin has a message written in red, possibly lipstick or makeup, saying \"The Writhing Clot\". They also find a box of eight high-quality cigars, which they light up. The last box contains a locket with a picture of Rock, one of the characters, as a human, which unsettles him as he is not human.

includes Rock's temporary transformation into a human. The group concludes that they were not teleported but experienced a real physical change. After leaving the theater, they find Valiant and Casimir outside, who are shocked at their battered state. They inform them that they have been gone for only about seven minutes, despite the group feeling like they were gone for at least two hours. They warn Valiant and Casimir about a man eating people in the lobby and people with a mind virus running through the sewers. They suggest that the constables should be informed to prevent the spread of the mind virus. The group continues their discussion about their recent encounter in the theater, sharing details with Kazimir, who offers them a ride back to the city. They decide to stay at a fancy place called the Gilded Lily, where they can rest and recuperate. Kazimir informs them that he will let the rest of the combine know about their availability for jobs and promises to keep them updated about any new information regarding the theater incident. He also sends them a token of his appreciation, a beautifully brocaded coat known as the Coat of the Combine. While at the Gilded Lily, the group identifies the item they found in the theater as Sovereign Glue, a powerful adhesive. They also receive another package containing tattered yellow linen robes and a note from a mysterious figure known as The Stranger, who expresses enjoyment of their previous encounter and hints at a possible future meeting. The group is intrigued and slightly unnerved by this message. The session ends with the group preparing to have dinner and planning to investigate any rumors or information they might come across in the dining room. They also level up, gaining new abilities and skills for future encounters. In this role-playing game session, the characters discuss what to do with a mask they have acquired. They debate whether to put it in a black hole, with some expressing fear about leaving it out in the open. Despite some initial hesitation, they eventually decide to put the mask in the black hole, which also contains a star fragment. The characters also discuss their plans for the next day, which include having dinner and possibly taking on some jobs.

party wakes up in the Gilded Lily, a luxurious hotel in the city, after a long rest. Rock discovers that the eye on the back of his head, a symptom of the gibbering mouther's disease, has disappeared. Bo, looking through the Chronicle, finds references to gibbering mouthers and learns that those affected by their reality-warping abilities can turn into gibbering mouthers over time. Valiant, the party's commander, is already downstairs for breakfast. She advises the party that they don't need to accept every job offer they receive in the city and should consider what they want to accomplish. She suggests they take advantage of their reputation and recruit more members for their operations. Valiant also tasks Trigger with completing Martin's work on locating the third star fragment, as the previous two have been associated with strange occurrences. She mentions that access to the city's Mages Guild would require approval from one of the other guilds. For Bo, Valiant suggests strengthening their spy network in the city, potentially finding someone to lead their operations or infiltrating the journeyman to steal information. She proposes waiting for reports from their scouts in Moscow and Baku before making any decisions. Lastly, Valiant suggests to Eldrin that they send their scout corps back on the roads to investigate the recent attacks, as they might be of little use in the city. She suspects that some of the jobs they receive might send them back on the road. The team discusses their next steps in the city of Muscathar. Specter suggests making contact with the head of the clock's operations, a figure known as the Eel. They also consider reestablishing contact with Casimir, a powerful figure in the city who might be able to help them source useful items. Valiant decides to stay behind for a lunch meeting with Lady Shiona Silverlight, the master of the Metalworkers Guild, while the rest of the team accompanies Constable Cadbury to question Albert Wilmarth, a friend of Bertrand, the composer involved in the mysterious theater incident.

also mentions two unfamiliar names from the playbill of Bertrand's last opera, Ramsey and the Stranger, the latter of whom was cast in a premier role. The team is left with more questions about the plot of the opera and the identities of these two individuals. The party, consisting of Elgin, Bo, and Trigger, along with Constable Cadbury, continue their investigation into the mysterious playwright Bertrand. They visit Albert, a bookkeeper and friend of Bertrand, who provides them with valuable information. Albert reveals that Bertrand was always secretive about his plays and would lock himself away while writing. He also mentions that Bertrand was particularly excited about his latest play, which he considered his magnum opus. Albert also reveals that Bertrand had been working with a man named Ramsey, which was unusual as Bertrand typically worked alone. He also mentions a third friend, Kers, a stonemason. Albert provides the party with the addresses of both Bertrand and Kers. During their conversation, Albert recognizes the party's name, Genesis Gambit, and is surprised to see them, believing they had been destroyed. He reveals that he has a portion of the group's chronicle, which he purchased from a halfling named Jester Greenhill several years ago. Albert offers to give the chronicle to the party if they can find Bertrand alive. The party then decides to have lunch in the city's red-light district, Hounds, hoping to gather more information. Cadbury, however, excuses himself due to his position as a constable. He suggests they meet later at Kers' house. Before parting ways, Cadbury reveals that he and Valiant, a member of Genesis Gambit, had worked together in the past and he wanted to ensure the party was trustworthy. He then hints at a potential job offer for the party. The group of characters, including Cadbury, a senior constable, discuss a potential job involving a series of warehouses occupied by smugglers. The owners of the warehouses and the constable area have been trying to negotiate with the smugglers to leave, but to no avail.

group discusses the risk of the mission, noting that the smugglers are effective and dangerous. They also find it strange that the smugglers have taken over a warehouse in the city, as smugglers usually keep to the islands off the coast. The warehouse belongs to the Stonemasons Guild, who have been unable to remove the smugglers. The group debates whether to take the job, considering the potential political implications within the city. They also consider other tasks, such as investigating Bertrand's house, a crime scene. They decide to go to Bertrand's house first, as they believe the smugglers are not going anywhere in the short term. The group plans to tackle the warehouse situation later. The group, consisting of Elgin, Chick, Specter, Trigger, and Bo, continue their investigation in the city of Easleton, which is described as a gentrified district. They arrive at Bertrand's house, a two-story Victorian-style home in the affluent part of the district, around 4 PM. The house is under guard by constables, but no one has entered it yet. Upon entering, they find themselves in a spacious foyer leading to a salon and a series of other rooms. The salon is neat and organized, with a pile of newspapers on the coffee table. Specter picks up the top newspaper and finds it dated for the next day, with a front-page story about the events that happened in the theater. The second newspaper contains a record of every conversation the group has had since they arrived in Muscovar, ending with their conversation with Cadbury before entering the house. The group conducts several experiments to understand the nature of the newspapers, but the content remains unchanged. They decide to pocket the newspapers and continue their exploration. Trigger, while investigating for traps, disturbs a patch of black mold in the Butler pantry, causing him to become poisoned. The group then moves on to the kitchen, which is in stark contrast to the salon, being a complete mess with pots, pans, and rotting food everywhere. On the swinging door between the kitchen and the dining room, they find a cryptic message written in oil paint: \"Words can so easily glide over mayhem and terror and horror.

paint is dry, indicating it's not very old. In the kitchen, Bo lifts a pot lid to find a soup filled with left thumbs, causing a sense of horror among the group. Despite the disturbing discoveries, they decide to continue their investigation. The group continues their investigation in Bertrand's house. They first explore the dining room, where they find a large table with life-size marionettes seated around it. Each marionette has a bronze name tag, six of which bear the group's names. The other four marionettes are labeled \"The Stranger,\" \"The Herald,\" \"Bertrand,\" and one with a painted crown, presumably representing \"The Last King.\" Next, they move to Bertrand's study, which is in chaos with torn papers and discarded sheet music. They find playbills identical to those they saw in the theater. Despite the mess, they don't find any significant clues. The group then decides to explore the basement, where they are met with a strong smell and a sight of black mold covering the walls. They quickly retreat after realizing the mold is toxic, causing them to suffer poison damage. Upstairs, they find three rooms. The first room they enter is Bertrand's bedroom, which is messy but not trashed. The group notices a strange smell coming from the bed. Upon investigation, they discover black spores puffing out from the mattress. In the midst of this, Bo notices something large in Grimm's pocket. Grimm pulls out a cream-colored envelope containing a beautifully hand-printed invitation addressed to him. The invitation is for a masquerade ball celebrating the birthday of Casilda, Queen of the Royal Court of Carcosa, a character from the play. The event is scheduled for a week from the current date. The group then moves on to the next room, which turns out to be an artist's studio. The session ends without any further significant discoveries. The group continues their exploration of Bertrand's house, starting with the basement. They find a room filled with paintings, including one of a woman who looks like a younger version of the woman in the portrait upstairs. The painting is signed by Bertrand, suggesting he might be older than he appears.

some of the group members being naturally unstealthy, the spell provided a significant boost, allowing them to move quietly. They continued down the hallway, with the chanting growing louder, indicating they were moving in the right direction. However, Rock, who was wearing heavy armor, made a noise that could potentially alert any creatures in the catacombs to their presence. The group was deciding their next move when the session ended. In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party continues their exploration of a dark, bone-filled catacomb. As they navigate, they encounter a sinkhole, which nearly swallows Rock, the heavily armored character. However, he manages to save himself with a successful dexterity saving throw. The party hears chanting in Abyssal, a language none of them understand. However, Rock recognizes two words: Azarum, the name of the Orc civilization, and Orcus, a name associated with necromancy. This revelation causes unease among the party, who decide to proceed with caution. Bo, the stealthy character, takes the lead and discovers a room filled with ghouls and a human figure in tattered red robes, presumably the missing archbishop. The archbishop is performing a ritual with a skull in green flame. Upon being spotted, the archbishop welcomes the party to \"Death's Embrace\" and a battle ensues. Eldren, another party member, rushes in and casts Thunderwave, a powerful spell that damages and pushes back all the ghouls. He then summons his Starfire Archer and shoots the archbishop with a radiant arrow. The archbishop, in turn, casts Spirit Guardians, a spell that summons spirits to protect him. Bo retaliates by shooting the archbishop with a crossbow, dealing both piercing and psychic damage. Trigger, another party member, casts Chromatic Orb, dealing thunder damage to the archbishop. Despite the heavy damage inflicted, the archbishop shows no physical reaction, leading the party to suspect that the skull he's holding might be the key to defeating him. The session ends with the ghouls attacking Bo. In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party continues their battle against the Archbishop and his ghouls in the catacombs. Eldren, the druid, uses a Thunderwave spell to damage the Archbishop and two ghouls, causing one ghoul to disintegrate and the other to be fatally

Archbishop, despite being severely wounded, continues his ritual with a skull, which begins to show hairline fractures. Eldren then attacks the Archbishop with a Starry Form Archer, causing the Archbishop to collapse, though the ritual continues. The skull's eyes flare, and a bolt of necrotic energy strikes Eldren, causing him to fall unconscious. Beau, the rogue, kills a ghoul, while Trigger, the wizard, attempts to destroy the skull with magic missiles but misses. Rock, the fighter, kills the last ghoul and charges towards the skull, taking damage from the Archbishop's Spirit Guardians spell. He uses an action surge to cast Thunderwave, causing the Archbishop's body to skitter away and the skull to fracture further. Suddenly, the skull explodes in a burst of green flame, and the party is forced to make constitution saving throws. The session ends on this cliffhanger. In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party, consisting of Eldren, Beau, Trey, and Rock, successfully defeated a necromantic entity inhabiting a skull in the catacombs beneath the Chantry. The entity was revealed to be the Archbishop, who had been taken over by evil spirits and was chanting the name \"Orcus.\" The party managed to destroy the skull, thus ending the necromantic threat. After the battle, the party was severely injured and decided to return to the surface. They were met by Tybalt, Mila, and Bishop Zorian, who were shocked and devastated to see the Archbishop's body. The party explained the situation and were rewarded with 500 gold for their efforts. Despite their injuries, the party decided to take a short rest and then return to the catacombs to explore the areas they had previously missed. They found a room that had been ransacked, with books torn apart and pages scattered. They collected the pages for further investigation. In the same room, they also found a small glass vial containing a fizzy, slightly green liquid that they suspected might be a potion of gaseous form. The party decided not to explore the stinky water area and instead chose to return to the surface with their findings.

entity was revealed to be a possessed Archbishop, who was unfortunately killed in the process. The team managed to retrieve some documents, a potion, and a handful of emerald stones from the basement. Upon returning to the surface, they informed Tybalt, a priest at the Chantry, about the Archbishop's fate and the lingering evil in the basement. They advised him to either seal the basement or have it cleansed. The team also offered Tybalt safe passage to Novigrad if he ever felt outcasted by the church. The team then returned to Novigrad and entered a downtime period. They received a payment of 686 gold pieces for their work, which they discussed investing in various areas such as the spy network, the quartermaster's network, the scout corps, or improving the effectiveness of their fighting forces. However, they decided to prioritize information gathering, considering investing in the spy and scouting networks. The session ended with Trigger suggesting they head to Muscovar and investigate a certain individual, potentially setting the direction for their next adventure. In this session of the role-playing game, the group discusses their strategy for allocating resources and investing in their networks. They decide to keep a couple of hundred gold as \"walking around money\" for immediate needs like travel and random item purchases, and invest the rest in long-term projects. They consider investing in a spy network, which they believe will be beneficial in the long run. They also discuss the possibility of crafting magic items, which would require some gold for resources. The group also reflects on their recent combat encounters, noting that they've had combat in every session so far. They express a desire to keep the action consistent, rather than having long stretches without combat. One of the characters, Aldrin, has died twice in the game so far, once from falling into a pit. The group jokes about this, suggesting they should invest in hay and flowers to keep Aldrin happy. The group also discusses the need to get to know the non-player characters (NPCs) better and the importance of increasing their prestige by completing jobs and being flashy. They acknowledge that they are in competition with other merchant companies and that their success may attract more enemies.

leyline a font of power Multple layers on this thing for a thousand years We were just at the top We could go down forever Only that level was probably Orcus ALl the prior archbishops knew catacombs were bad so blocked it The Skull was a powerful servant of Orcus and the ritual would have returned him to spread orcus funk THE PAPERS Confirm that the Chantry is built on some sort of leyline or font of power Leylines aren t really well understood or studied there could be plenty that people are not aware of or locations that people THINK are leylines but actually aren t But the Chantry location is as confirmed as it can be The Dawnfather potentially consecrated this location himself before the gods removed themselves from the world There are multiple layers underground more than what you saw Temples have been built and torn down there for over a thousand years Apparently the old invading orcs worshipped Orcus Or at least the ones there did And prior Archbishops knew about the catacombs and about the skull If not specifically then in stories and references The skull which isn t given a name in the papers was apparently a powerful servant of Orcus If the probably ritual was performed and the necessary amount of blood provided the servant would return in full free to spread Orcus s gift of undeath There are notes in the margin presumably from the Archbishop It seems he was called down here in some manner He thought the Dawnfather was trying to tell him something To destroy the skull before it could be used for great evil The Archbishop seemed to believe that something terrible was coming He came down here for weeks between his duties never staying for too long because of the necromantic energy The last note says he found the skull The nothing Bo records

this session of the role-playing game, the team returns to Castle Wren after a successful mission. They are greeted by their head scout, Hawthorne, who introduces them to Feather, a half-elf guard who has joined their company. This addition increases their scout corps level to one. Later, Rock, the lieutenant, has a conversation with Commander Valiant about the future of their company, Genesis Gambit. They discuss the need for discipline among their ranks and the potential challenges of attracting attention as they grow in power. Valiant expresses her confidence in Rock's leadership abilities. The team then discusses how to allocate their resources. They decide to invest 100 gold pieces into their fence network, which will pay off on every job they undertake in the future. They also invest 200 gold pieces into establishing a spy network in Muscovar, a rich city where they have contacts and potential plot hooks. They decide to keep the remaining 261 gold pieces for future needs. During a training session, Grim, one of the team members, is approached by Blue, a young water genasi. Blue asks Grim if he knows when he will be able to go home, as promised by Commander Valiant. Grim promises to inquire about it. In this session, the characters continue their interactions with the members of their company. Rock and Valiant discuss the company's finances and decide to invest in a fence network in Muscovado. Rock also has a conversation with Blue, a water genasi who is feeling homesick and wants to return to his home in Quintessence. However, the only known portal to Quintessence is located in the dangerous Plane of Fire, making it nearly impossible for Blue to return home. The characters also participate in a town event called the Lamentation of the Lost, a holiday dedicated to remembering those who gave their lives in service to others. During the event, Specter and Boa notice Valiant clutching a small purple glove, which they later learn belonged to her deceased sister. Later, Hawthorne, a member of the company, approaches Eldren and asks him why he left the forest.

also discuss the performance of Daria's nephew, who managed to survive a dangerous mission due to his lack of ambition. In this session of the Genesis Gambit campaign, the party spent their downtime in various activities. Rock and Eldrin focused on training and improving their skills, while Bo spent his time translating and interpreting the papers he found in the catacombs of the Chantry. The papers revealed that the Chantry was built on a ley line or font of power, consecrated by the Dawn Father himself. The catacombs were built by orcs who worshipped Orcus, and the skull they found was a powerful servant of Orcus. The Archbishop believed he was called to destroy the skull, but was possessed before he could do so. Meanwhile, the political landscape of the Broken Kingdom changed. The disappearances in Granite Hills were solved, and the village turned to Kazan for leadership. Muscovar renewed trade agreements with the Hill Dwarves of Oldguard, and the Priory of the Lake assumed control of the Chantry of Dawn. News of Genesis Gambit's heroic defense of a caravan spread through the Riverlands, but their association with a dead Archbishop generated mixed feelings. The party also made some investments, purchasing healing potions and securing options for future purchases. They also received updates on the political map, showing the shifting zones of control among the various factions. The session ended with the party waiting for their scout network to return with new job opportunities. In this role-playing game session, the characters are visited by a man named Martin Broadcloak, a cosmologist from the Academy in Baku. Martin tells them about a shooting star he observed that exploded in the sky, with a fragment landing on a farm south of Dresden. He explains that the people and livestock on the farm have become sick and crazed, and strange, unnatural growths have appeared. Martin requests the characters' help in retrieving the star fragment and dealing with the situation on the farm. The characters agree to help, with Eldren, a Circle of Stars Druid, showing particular interest in the cosmic event. Martin offers a diplomat's pouch, a valuable item that allows communication with high-ranking individuals, as payment for their services.

group decides to travel to the farm, with Martin accompanying them. As they approach the farm, they notice signs of the unnatural phenomena Martin described, such as plants appearing dry and brittle or overgrown, and water sources appearing fouled. The session ends as they enter the affected region. The group, consisting of Specter, Grim, Rock, Eldrin, and Bo, along with their guide Martin, approach a farmstead where a star fragment is believed to be located. The area is eerily silent and the landscape is unnaturally distorted, with a pumpkin patch growing out of season. As they approach the well where the fragment is supposed to be, two gray, lifeless figures, presumably once farmers, emerge from the house and attack. Specter takes the lead box from Eldrin and attempts to cover the fragment, which appears to be a crumbling piece of rock with a divot where something once was. The farmers attack Grim, but their attacks miss. Grim retaliates by casting Gust of Wind, attempting to push the farmers back, but they resist the force of the wind. Rock then steps in, slashing one of the farmers into dust with a powerful attack. Eldrin attempts to hit the remaining farmer with a Guiding Bolt spell, but misses. He then moves to inspect the well, finding a swirling mass of color at the bottom, suggesting that the fragment might have been thrown down there. Meanwhile, Bo, who had cast invisibility on himself earlier, decides to maintain his invisibility and enters the house to scout for more enemies. In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party continues their battle against the mutated livestock and farmers. Specter, feeling heroic, decides to jump into the well where the meteorite is believed to be. Despite taking some damage, he successfully retrieves a small, hard object from the bottom of the well, which he believes to be the meteorite, and places it in a lead box. Meanwhile, an enormous, swirling color, described as an Aurora Borealis, emerges from the well and hovers over the battlefield. It begins to sing a discordant song that resonates with Rock, causing him to sway and become entranced. The rest of the party, except for Bo, are forced to make wisdom saving throws to resist the song's effects.

however, finds the song beautiful and is not affected. Grimbore attacks one of the farmers, severely wounding him, and then uses his action surge to attack one of the mutated animals. Rock, under the influence of the song, stands motionless and does not take any actions. Eldrin prepares to cast Thunderwave on the approaching enemies. The session ends with the party still in the midst of battle, facing both the mutated creatures and the mysterious singing entity. In this session of the role-playing game, the characters are engaged in a battle against a large, ethereal entity referred to as the \"Aurora Borealis\" and a group of hostile farmers and livestock. Grimgor, one of the characters, uses his wind spell to push back three of the farmers, causing minor damage. He then moves closer to the enemy, bringing the wind with him. He also successfully attacks and eliminates one of the farmers. Eldred, another character, drinks wine from his magic amulet, which heals him. He attempts to attack the Aurora Borealis with a guiding bolt but fails. Bo, who is invisible, attacks the Aurora Borealis with a hand crossbow and a psychic dagger. The dagger seems to cause significant damage to the entity, suggesting it might be vulnerable to psychic attacks. However, the Aurora Borealis retaliates, causing Bo significant cold and fire damage. Specter, who has been at the bottom of a well, climbs out and joins the battle. He successfully attacks one of the farmers with a sneak attack, causing damage. The Aurora Borealis moves and attempts to attack Bo again, causing more damage. The farmers also attack, causing damage to Rock, another character. The session ends with the characters still engaged in the battle. In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party faced off against a mysterious entity known as \"The Color.\" The encounter was triggered when Specter jumped into a well to retrieve a diamond, causing the entity to emerge. The Color had a hypnotic song that caused confusion and fear among the party and the livestock in the area. The party fought against The Color and the livestock, which had turned aggressive.

Muscovar arrives at Castle Rend Here is what she told you As you re aware trade through the Brass Door is extremely valuable especially to a city like Muscovar What is less valuable are the taxes which Kazan charges for passage through the Channel Gate to and from the Door They grind our margins near to dust Some time ago we identified a path through the mountains which circumvents the Gate It is dangerous and can only be traversed on foot no mounts so we only use it for small high value goods Now the punchline A group of Journeyman carrying such a special order is overdue They were expected at my camp more than week ago I obviously can t go to Kazan for help The Barrowmen was my next choice they were the closest but they re away on a job to the south So here I am My master s concern is for his Journeyman There were four of them The mission is to find and return them 50 gold dead 150 gold alive each The item they were transporting is of secondary concern but a bonus of 150

group returned to Castle Wren after their encounter at the farm, where they had successfully captured the star fragment. Martin Broadcloak, the astrologer, was pleased with the outcome and expressed interest in studying the fragment further. He also mentioned that there might be more fragments scattered across the area. Upon their return, they met Holly Honeyholt, the matriarch of the Honeyholt Acres Farm, who was discussing an opportunity with Valiant, their commander. Holly suggested that the group should focus on bigger tasks while the rank and file members of Genesis Gambit took care of patrolling the road. During their stay at Castle Wren, Bo and Valiant spent days writing letters to various contacts, announcing the arrival of Genesis Gambit and their readiness for mercenary work. A messenger from the Chantry arrived with a box and a letter from Bishop Zorian, expressing gratitude for the group's assistance at the Chantry. The box contained a Chantry Lantern, a magical item that could ward off undead creatures when lit with holy water. The group decided to keep the lantern, with Elgin volunteering to carry it. Bishop Zorian also invited the group to his ascension ceremony to the position of Archbishop, with the date to be announced later. During this session, the characters are at their castle when Bo, the castle's spymaster, notices that someone has been snooping around. The intruder has not stolen or damaged anything, but has been looking through personal items in Bo and Valiant's rooms. Bo sets up traps to catch the intruder, but instead finds a smiley face drawn in the flour he had sprinkled on the floor, indicating that the intruder is aware of his attempts. Valiant suspects that the intruder is Valentina, the spymaster of Baku, who is known for her extensive spy network. They decide to invest in their own spy network in Baku to counteract this threat, leaving them with only 26 gold.

Valiant, and Eldrin visit Daria's shop where she shows them a potion of healing, a scroll of feather, and a magical greatsword that was involved in some drama. Daria offers one of the items for free as a token of appreciation for their business partnership. The characters have yet to decide which item to choose. The group receives a letter from the Bank of Riga, offering them a job to carry out a strategic initiative near the ruins of Saratov. The job promises a flat fee of 500 gold, but the group suspects they are being lowballed. They decide to wait for other responses before making a decision. A few days later, a rider arrives at Castle Rand from Kazimir Kulik, the master of the Spices Guild in Muscov. The rider, a severe-looking woman, requests a private meeting with the group. She reveals that a group of journeymen carrying a special order through a dangerous mountain pass has gone missing. The group is offered 50 gold for each journeyman found dead and 150 gold for each found alive. A bonus will also be given if the item they were transporting is found and returned. The group learns that the mountain pass is heavily patrolled and dangerous, with access points to the Underdark. The woman urges the group to venture forth as soon as possible to find the missing journeymen. The group is left to decide their next course of action. In this session, the group receives three job offers. The first is from the Bank of Riga, who needs them to investigate a potential threat in Saratov within two weeks. The second is from Casimir, who needs them to rescue four men trapped in the city of Brass Gate within three days. The third is from Gorek Karuskan, headmaster of the Iron Monastery, who needs them for an urgent and dangerous task, but provides no further details. After some deliberation, the group decides to accept the first two jobs and reject the third. They plan to rescue the men in Brass Gate first, then head to Saratov to fulfill the Bank's request.

the potential threat these goblins pose to future travelers, the group decides to ignore them and continue on their journey due to their tight schedule. In this role-playing game session, the characters are traveling on a quiet road through flat plains and dry scrubland, heading towards the larger lake towns from Raventree. Suddenly, the earth rumbles beneath them, and a massive insect-like creature bursts from the ground. The characters, Specter, Bo, Grim, and Eldrim, along with a journeyman, engage in a battle with the creature. Specter strikes first, dealing a significant amount of damage. The creature retaliates by attacking Danny Druid, causing substantial harm. The journeyman struggles to control her frightened horse, and Specter attempts to help but fails, causing the horse to panic further. Bo uses his kinetic ability to push the creature back and then shoots at it, causing it to bleed acidic blood. The creature then burrows underground, disappearing from sight.

The creature is now marked, making it easier for the next attack to hit. The session ends with Eldrim in the hole, facing the creature. In this session of the Dungeons and Dragons campaign, the party, consisting of Grim, Eldrin, Specter, and Bo, continue their journey westward. They are accompanied by Journeyman, a dangerous woman with poor animal handling skills. The party starts by discussing their next steps and deciding to take on two jobs. The first job involves investigating a missing person, while the second job is about a mysterious message from a messenger.

creature emerges from the ground and attacks the party. Grim, who had held his action, attacks the ankheg with his battle ax, dealing damage but also taking acid damage from the creature's wounds. The ankheg then sprays acid all around it, causing significant damage to the party. Specter throws his short sword at the ankheg, dealing a fatal blow. The creature collapses, spraying a final burst of acid that injures Grim. With the ankheg defeated, Eldrin emerges from his hiding place and uses his healing abilities to restore the party's health. He casts Healing Word on Bo, who had been incapacitated, and also heals Grim and Specter. With their health restored, the party decides to continue their journey.

9 The Journeyman Job part 2 The recording is HERE Company Treasury two potions of healing Rok and Grim each have 26 gold potion of gaseous form Chantry Lantern Eldrin carrying Sword of Blind Faith Rok carrying Dust of disappearance BM comment I can t remember if Journeyman gave you descriptions of the four missing persons It was one human man found dead one human woman one red skinned tiefling woman we killed and one half orc man Each wearing the same kind of dark blue and leather traveling clothes cloak BM comment Random reminder that if someone is unconscious and rolling death saves you can attempt to stabilize them with a Medicine check It takes an action and you have to be next to them and all it does is stop them from dying they won t wake up so it isn t always the optimal choice in a fight Just didn t want y all to forget this was a thing you can do We take a short rest on the top of the mountain In the possessions of the dead guy a small volcanic rock box with a collection of small pouches in it Trigger accidentally sniffs it has a coughing fit lucky Con Save Essence of Ember Extremely spicey spicey We move towards the caves following tracks we find the body of a redskin tiefling woman wearing the same clothes Her horns have been removed Spectre and Bo go to inspect the body Spectre notices something about the body there s a lump where there shouldn t be Bo uses Mage Hand to life up the cloak and a fireball goes off kills the woman who dies screaming 6d6 fire damage avoided Who was the trap for Eldrin notices draft from seam in false wall We explore the pretty door Trigger read the bad words and went catatonic We re deciding whether to burn them He snapped outr of it We tussle with mad scientist woman whos about to entube the orc Spectre gets the klling blow We rescue the orc The Mad Scientist Talks The possibility is possible A likely likelihood indeed a certain certainty There is no distinction betwixt the real and the unreal all things appear as they do only by virtue of the delicate individual physical and mental media through which we are made conscious of them And it was under a horned waning moon that I saw the city for the first time Still and somnolent it did lie on a strange plateau in a hollow betwixt strange peaks Of ghastly marble were its walls and its towers its columns domes and BOMBS The brain is wider than the sky For put them side by side The one the other will contain With ease and you beside The brain is deeper than the sea For hold them blue to blue The one the other will absorb As sponges buckets do Bo does read thoughts on the Trauma Dumb Half Orc They were ambushed in their tent waiting out the storm and maddie the mad scientiest iced them all to make steampunk horrors BM comment When Bo was invisible and spoke into maddie s mind she called him a dreamer Later when he dropped invisibility she said ah there s the dreamer tell me have you dreamed of any lights recently During the long rest following this encounter Bo dreamed of a single candle in the dark Bo would also be reminded of his original dream after which he gained his telepathic abilities Journeyman says Kazimir Kulyk will send the gold to us We walk towards Saratov where the next job is We come across a broken down carriage they ask us for help A minotaur steps out of the carriage He s huge bigger than Rok They fix the carriage The Minotaur knows Bo Archivist Asterion Bo offers him the Toxic Text from the Mad Scientist Does Time Exist Travelling backwards in TIme Books kept in restricted sections Most powerful wizards can only stop time it s quite Cliff collapses onto a village Lots of death You cut down the trees erosion Cause and effect is complex A cliff collapses onto a village killing hundreds The effect death The cause the cliff s collapse Of course if one were to then speak of cutting down every tree within sight including those above that cliff as the true cause of the disaster a cause that in its essence lay at the feet of the very victims then fierce denial was the response or even more pathetic blank confusion And if one were to then elaborate on the economic pressures that demanded such rapacious deforestation ranging from the need for firewood among the locals and the desire to clear land for pasture to increase herds all the way to the hunger for wood to meet the shipbuilding needs of a port city leagues distant in order to go to war with a neighbouring kingdom over contested fishing areas contested because the shoals were vanishing leading to the threat of starvation in

group of adventurers, consisting of Rock, Eldren, Danny, and Trigger, are on a mission to find four missing journeymen in service to Kazimir Kulik of the Spicer's Guild. They have ascended a mountain and found a strange creature, a snow mutant monstrosity, which they defeated. They also discovered the body of one of the journeymen, a human man who died from exposure, missing both his teeth and tongue. In the tent used by the journeymen, they found normal travel gear and a polished box of volcanic rock containing hundreds of small paper baggies filled with a brownish, reddish sand. The sand, referred to as \"essence of ember\" in a note found with the box, is a potent spice from the City of Brass. The note warns that failure to thoroughly cook the spice can result in severe health issues. The group decides to keep some of the spice for potential future use. After taking a short rest, the group decides to explore the rest of the mountaintop. They follow the tracks of the mutant creature to a small cave, where they find the body of a red-skinned tiefling woman, one of the missing journeymen. Her horns are missing, which raises the group's suspicion that there might be another creature similar to the one they defeated earlier. As they investigate the cave and the body, Specter notices a suspicious lump in the woman's cloak. The group decides to proceed with caution, suspecting a potential trap. The session ends with the group preparing to further investigate the lump and the cave. The group of adventurers, consisting of Specter, Eldridge, Rock, and Trigger, continue their exploration of the mountain cave. They discover a secret door, which leads them into a natural cave with two paths. One path leads to a room filled with animal body parts hanging from hooks, while the other path splits into two directions, one leading to a storage area and the other to a room with a desk and two tables covered in blood. Specter investigates the room with the hanging body parts but finds nothing of interest. Meanwhile, Eldridge casts Detect Magic to sense any magical presence within 30 feet, but detects nothing. Rock and Trigger decide to investigate the room with the desk and tables.

the desk, Trigger finds a collection of drawings and scribblings. The drawings depict the anatomy of the monster they previously fought, while the scribblings are nonsensical phrases and scratched-out drawings. As Trigger flips through the pages, he becomes absorbed in them and falls into a trance-like state. Despite Rock's attempts to snap him out of it, Trigger remains unresponsive. The group decides to tie him up for safety as they continue their exploration. The group finds themselves in a room filled with supplies and two unopened doors. Trig reads some papers and loses his mind, forgetting everything he read. The group decides to keep the papers for later, suspecting they might be valuable or cursed. They discuss their next move, considering using the Chantry Lantern filled with holy water to potentially ward off undead creatures. However, they decide against it as they haven't encountered any undead yet. They decide to use Moriarty's familiar, Talk, to scout the rooms behind the doors. Talk is sent through one of the doors and finds a half-orc man in a cage, five tanks with twitching things inside, and a humanoid woman wearing a rebreather mask. The woman notices Talk and starts questioning if it's a dream or reality. The group debates their next move, considering freeing the half-orc man, trying to convince the woman they are the \"big bad guy\" she's been chasing, or using entangle to restrain her. They decide to lure the woman out of the room. As they open the door, Talk flies out, and the woman follows it. She then unlocks the half-orc's cage and starts dragging him towards the tanks. The group decides to storm the room, with Moriarty sneaking in to observe the situation and Talk distracting the woman by landing on the cage. In this Dungeons and Dragons session, the party continues their confrontation with a mad scientist in a laboratory filled with tanks containing grotesque creatures. The scientist is in the process of torturing a half-orc, which the party tries to prevent.

the scientist retaliates by throwing a vial at Specter, causing him to fall unconscious from the damage. Rock tries to attack the scientist with a new ability, but misses. Eldrin then casts Entangle, causing vines to sprout from the ground and restrain the scientist and the half-orc. He also takes on the Starry Form of Chalice. In response, the scientist pulls a lever, releasing one of the creatures from its tank. The creature attacks Trigger, who manages to deflect one of the attacks with a shield spell. Meanwhile, the invisible Bow moves into position and attacks the scientist, dealing significant damage and revealing his presence. The scientist recognizes Bow as a \"dreamer\" and throws a vial at him, but misses. Trigger then rushes to Specter's aid, healing him and bringing him back to consciousness. He also maintains concentration on the Dragon's Breath spell, allowing Tock to continue using it. The session ends with Trigger fleeing the room. In this session of the role-playing game, the party continues their battle against a mad scientist and her monstrous creations. The scientist, a human woman, is revealed to be conducting horrific experiments on living beings, creating grotesque and unnatural creatures. The party's gnome, Eldren, uses an Entangle spell to restrain the scientist, preventing her from releasing more monsters from the vats in the room. This strategic move proves to be a game-changer, saving the party from a potentially brutal fight. Spector, who had been severely injured, retreats to recover, while Rock, despite being poisoned, bravely confronts the scientist. He lands a critical hit, severely wounding her. Eldren then uses a Guiding Bolt spell, dealing significant damage. In a desperate move, the scientist throws a poison bomb at Rock, who manages to shield himself. However, the explosion affects a nearby half-orc, one of the scientist's victims, who falls unconscious. Eldren quickly heals him, stabilizing his condition. Spector then delivers the final blow to the scientist, killing her. In her dying moments, she reveals that she was driven by a dream of creating a city of ghastly marble walls, towers, and columns.

the battle, the party investigates the room, finding more of the scientist's disturbing drawings. They also discover another room containing cages, one of which holds a catatonic human woman and another a seemingly lifeless griffin. The party manages to unlock the woman's cage, but her condition remains unchanged. The session ends with the party contemplating their next move, having successfully defeated the mad scientist and her monstrous creations. The party, consisting of Eldrin, Rock, Specter, and Danny, successfully rescued two journeymen, a half-orc man and a human woman, from a cave in the mountains. They also found two dead bodies and a griffon, which Eldrin managed to heal and release. The rescued journeymen were initially disoriented but regained their senses after a long rest. They explained that they were ambushed and taken captive while returning from a pickup. The party then returned to their camp near Channel Gate, where they met with the journeyman who had hired them. She thanked them for their efforts and promised to send a runner with their payment of 550 gold to their castle within a week. Rock suggested keeping the parcel they had retrieved as collateral until they received their payment, but Specter assured him that Kazimir, the person who would pay them, was trustworthy. The party then set off for Saratoga, a two-day journey from their current location. On the way, they encountered a broken wagon with a couple of people struggling to fix it. Rock offered to help while the others kept a lookout for potential ambushes. In this session of the Dungeons and Dragons game, the party continues their journey and encounters a mad scientist named Dr. Zara. She is a gnome who has been experimenting with a dangerous substance called \"Dragon's Breath\". The party engages in a battle with her, during which Specter is killed by the Dragon's Breath. However, the party manages to defeat Dr. Zara and revive Specter using a potion. After the battle, the party finds a scroll case containing toxic texts that drove Dr. Zara mad.
